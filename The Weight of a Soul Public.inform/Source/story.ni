Volume 1 - Preamble

[Hello reader! This is the source code for the Spring Thing 2021 release of The Weight of a Soul. It's provided as a teaching tool for new Inform writers and a case study for those trying to get more out of the Inform 7 engine. I've done my best to add comments in the code to make it easier to read and understand.

As with most large projects, this source text has accumulated a bit of spaghetti code and black magic to get the whole thing working. I've forked this public release from an in-development build and cleaned it up to the best of my ability, but you will still see lots of unlabeled rules, unoptimized rulebooks, etc.

Finally, it should go without saying that this source text contains MASSIVE SPOILERS for The Weight of a Soul. If you don't want to be spoiled, stop reading now and finish playing the game!]

Part 1.1.3 - Miscellaneous Functions

The update chronological records rule is not listed in any rulebook.

The previous location is a room that varies.
Before reading a command (this is the update previous location rule):
	now the previous location is the location.
	
[This is part of a general movement to reduce reliance on the "update chronological records" rule, which becomes really slow on Quixe if you have too many past tense checks in the game.]

To say wait for any key: wait for any key.

[This allows us to write it directly inside the text without having to rely on tedious substitutions. Dangerous for cases where the text may be expanded, but useful for dialogue trees and scripted events using tables.]

This is the rest of the turn rule:
	follow the scene changing rules;
	follow the every turn rules;
	abide by the timed events rule;
	abide by the advance time rule;
	abide by the adjust light rule;
	abide by the note object acquisitions rule;
	abide by the notify score changes rule;
	follow the scene changing rules.

[This is the turn sequence rules minus the part that parses and follows a command. We use the 'rest of the turn rule' later when we reject the player's command but still want to advance the turn.]

Understand "i" as 1.
Understand "ii" as 2.
Understand "iii" as 3.
Understand "iv" as 4.
Understand "v" as 5.
Understand "vi" as 6.
Understand "vii" as 7.
Understand "viii" as 8.
Understand "ix" as 9.
Understand "x" as 10.

[I dunno, flavor I guess.]

Part 1.1.4 - Tweaked Extension Functionality

Chapter 1.1.4.1 - Rule Shifting

A room can be goto-passable or goto-impassable. A room is usually goto-passable.

This is the new approach-heading selection rule:
	now approach-heading is the best route from the location to the noun through goto-passable visited rooms, using doors;
	if approach-heading is not a direction:
		now approach-heading is the best route from the location to the noun through goto-passable visited rooms, using even locked doors;
	if approach-heading is not a direction:
		now approach-heading is the best route from the location to the noun through visited rooms, using even locked doors;
		if approach-heading is a direction:
			say "You can't go back that way.";
			rule fails.
			
The new approach-heading selection rule is listed instead of the approach-heading selection rule in the approach-finding rules.

[This allows us to make certain rooms impassable for approaching on the fly, which is handy when the player is barred from entering certain rooms by means other than locked doors.]

The unlocking before opening rule is not listed in any rulebook. [I didn't really want to include Locksmith, or this behavior.]

Part 1.1.5 - Room Names

A room has some text called the simple-name.

Rule for printing the name of a room (called the room in question) while the player is hurrying:
	say "[if the simple-name of the room in question is not empty][simple-name of the room in question][otherwise][printed name of the room in question][end if]";

Rule for printing the name of a room (called the room in question) while asking which do you mean:
	say "[if the simple-name of the room in question is not empty][simple-name of the room in question][otherwise][printed name of the room in question][end if]";
	
Rule for printing the name of a room (called the room in question) while clarifying the parser's choice of something:
	say "[if the simple-name of the room in question is not empty][simple-name of the room in question][otherwise][printed name of the room in question][end if]";

The can't approach our current location rule response (A) is "You are already in [if the simple-name of the location is not empty][simple-name of the location][otherwise][printed name of the location][end if]."

[The default Inform behavior for printing the names of rooms is weird. This allows us to define an alternate string in certain cases.

It turns out we call the simple-name most of the time, so I never experienced the recursion case until a baffling bug involving Cadaver Walk and its lack of a simple-name. It turns out that the distinction between [the room in question] and [printed name of the room in question] is extremely fucking important.]

Part 1.1.6 - Final Questions

When play begins (this is the new final question options rule):
	choose row 1 in the Table of Final Question Options;
	now the final question wording entry is "[begincmd]restart[endcmd]";
	choose row 2 in the Table of Final Question Options;
	now the final question wording entry is "[begincmd]restore[endcmd] a saved story";
	choose row 3 in the Table of Final Question Options;
	now the final question wording entry is "see some suggestions for [begincmd]amusing[endcmd] things to do";
	choose row 4 in the Table of Final Question Options;
	now the final question wording entry is "[begincmd]quit[endcmd]";
	choose row 5 in the Table of Final Question Options;
	now the final question wording entry is "[begincmd]undo[endcmd] the last command";
	
The print the final prompt rule response (A) is "[>][run paragraph on]".
	
Table of Final Question Options (continued) 
final question wording	only if victorious	topic	final response rule	final response activity
"view the [begincmd]help[endcmd] menu"	false	"help"	final questions help menu rule	--

This is the final questions help menu rule:
	now the current menu is the Table of the Help Menu;
	now the current menu title is "Help";
	carry out the displaying activity;
	clear the screen.

After printing the player's obituary (this is the ending notification rule):
	if story has ended finally:
		if Heroes Never Die is happening:
			say "You achieved Ending 1 of 7.";
		otherwise if Killed Justinian Ending is happening:
			if ending-agreed-with-justinian-premise is false:
				say "You achieved Ending 2 of 7.";
			otherwise:
				say "You achieved Ending 3 of 7.";
		otherwise if Walked Away Ending is happening:
			if ending-agreed-with-justinian-premise is false:
				say "You achieved Ending 4 of 7.";
			otherwise:
				say "You achieved Ending 5 of 7.";
		otherwise if Usurper Ending is happening:
			say "You achieved Ending 6 of 7.";
		otherwise if Collaborator Ending is happening:
			say "You achieved Ending 7 of 7.";

Part 1.1.7 - Debug Messages - Not for release
	
Understand "playtest" as a mistake ("[tester-commands-text]").
Understand "skipcmd" as a mistake ("[skip-commands-text]").

First after reading a command (this is the playtest comments rule):
	let T be "[the player's command]";
	if character number 1 in T is "*":
		say "Comment recorded.";
		reject the player's command.

To say tester-commands-text:
	say "When you start a playthrough, please type [begincmd]transcript[endcmd]. This will save the text of your playthrough to your browser cache. When you're done, type [begincmd]load[endcmd], click 'Edit', copy the text of your transcript, and send it to me.

Part 1.2.2 - Status Line

Chapter 1.2.2.1 - Status Line Variables

[We want to show the current day on the right hand status line. We use a variable to store it because a) there can be multiple concurrent scenes, so Inform doesn't know which one is relevant; and b) entering a dialogue changes the status line, and we'd like a foolproof way to restore it.]

The current day is a scene that varies. The current day is Prologue.
When Day One begins: now the current day is Day One.
When Day Two begins: now the current day is Day Two.
When Midnight begins: now the current day is Midnight.
When Day Three begins: now the current day is Day Three.
When Day Four begins: now the current day is Day Four.
When Epilogue begins: now the current day is Epilogue.

[When the player is engaged in dialogue, the right hand status line instead changes to "Talking to [the partner]". We likewise need a variable for this.]

The conversational partner text is some text that varies.

Chapter 1.2.2.2 - Constructing the Status Line

[We use Basic Screen Effects to construct the status line so that we can shift the right hand status line inward when it's too long. "Talking to Doctor Cavala" is a lot longer than 14 characters. We define the tables and rule for constructing the status line here; the actual shifting is dynamically done while starting and ending the dialogue.]

Table of Normal Status
left	central	right
" [location]"	""	"[if the current day is Prologue or the current day is Midnight or the current day is Epilogue][otherwise][current day]"

Table of Dialogue Status
left	central	right
" [location]"	""	"[conversational partner text]"

Table of Endoscopy Status
left	central	right
" [location]"	""	"[endoscopic subject text]"

Rule for constructing the status line:
	update status bar GUI;
	rule succeeds.

To update status bar GUI:
	if the player is engaged in dialogue:
		update status bar GUI with Table of Dialogue Status;
	otherwise if the player is engaged in endoscopy:
		update status bar GUI with Table of Endoscopy Status;
	otherwise:
		update status bar GUI with Table of Normal Status;

To update status bar GUI with (T - a table name):
	fill status bar with T;
	
Part 1.2.3 - Skip Commands - Not for release

Book 1.3 - People

Part 1.3.1 - Defining People

[This game includes a lot of interacting with people, and Inform's boilerplate facilities in this regard are lacking. The setting also introduces some hurdles because people can be of different fantasy races. Here we lay the groundwork for that by assigning new properties to people and letting the player refer to people by their properties.]

Definition: a person is other if it is not the player.
Does the player mean doing something with the player: it is unlikely.

A person can be friendly or hostile. A person is usually friendly. [This flag colors Marid's responses when interacting with that person.]

Understand "person" as a person. Understand "people" as the plural of a person. Understand "man" as a male person. Understand "men" as the plural of a male person. Understand "woman" as a female person. Understand "women" as the plural of a female person.

A person can be living, dead, or ghostly. A person is usually living. Understand "dead" or "body" or "corpse" or "cadaver" or "lifeless" as a dead person.  Understand "ghost" or "spirit" or "animus" as a ghostly person. 

Race is a kind of value. The races are human, goblin, mutant, mixed-race, and creature. A person has a race. The race of a person is usually human. Understand the race property as describing a person.
Understand "humans" as the plural of a human person. Understand "goblins" as the plural of a goblin person. Understand "mutants" as the plural of a mutant person.
Understand "human/goblin/mutant" as a mixed-race person. Understand "humans/goblins/mutants" as the plural of a mixed-race person.

mutant-tutorial-shown is a truth state that varies. mutant-tutorial-shown is false.

First before examining or talking to a mutant person when mutant-tutorial-shown is false (this is the 'what's a mutant'? tutorial rule):
	if time is not critical:
		say "(It has been some years now since the mutants of the Dark Lands were integrated into society, and you have mostly gotten used to their haphazard anatomy, their alien perception of the world. Mostly.)[paragraph break]";
		now mutant-tutorial-shown is true.
		
Part 1.3.2 - People Block Responses

[Here we add some colorful Marid-narrator-voice to replace Inform's boilerplate responses.]

The sound of a person is usually "[regarding the item described][They] [are][if the item described is dead] silent.[otherwise]n't saying anything."
		
Instead of drinking, switching on, switching off, or wearing someone (this is the can't do that to a person rule): say "That doesn't make any sense."
Instead of setting someone to something (this is the can't set people rule): say "That doesn't make any sense."

Instead of looking under something carried by an other living person (called the carrier), say "[regarding the noun][They're] what [the carrier] [are] carrying."

Instead of eating a living person, say "What a strange notion."
Instead of taking an other living non-faraway person (this is the new can't take people response rule): say "[regarding the noun]You lack the strength, even if [they] allowed you to."

Instead of attacking, cutting, knocking on, or pushing an other friendly non-faraway living person (this is the can't hurt friendly people rule): say "[if time is critical]This is not the time.[otherwise]That hardly seems called for."
Instead of kissing, pulling, rubbing, searching, smelling, swinging, squeezing, touching, or turning an other friendly non-faraway living person (this is the block actions on friendly people rule): say "[if time is critical]This is not the time.[otherwise]You aren't [italic type]that[roman type] friendly with [the noun]."

Instead of attacking or cutting an other hostile non-faraway living person (this is the can't hurt hostile people rule): say "You doubt that would end well for you."
Instead of knocking on, pulling, pushing, smelling, squeezing, touching, or turning an other hostile non-faraway living person (this is the can't provoke hostile people rule): say "You doubt that would go over well with [the noun]."
Instead of kissing, rubbing, or searching an other hostile non-faraway living person (this is the block actions on hostile people rule), say "You doubt [the noun] will let you do that."

Instead of eating a dead person, say "What a revolting notion."
Instead of eating something that is part of a dead person, say "What a revolting notion."
Instead of giving something to a dead person, say "You won't get much of a response."
Instead of pushing, pulling, or turning a dead non-faraway person, say "That won't accomplish anything."

Instead of searching a ghostly person, say "You won't find anything for the living."
Instead of kissing a ghostly person, say "Unlikely."
Instead of waking a ghostly person, say "[regarding the noun][Theirs] is a sleep from which there is no awakening."

Part 1.3.3 - Important Characters

[These are important characters who show up several times in various locations throughout the game. They were originally listed in the location of their first appearance, but as the plot gets more convoluted and characters shift around more, placing these characters here makes them easier to keep track of.]

Chapter 1.3.3.1 - Doctor Cavala

[Doctor Cavala is a mentor/parent figure to Marid. She's tough, stoic, and competent -- qualities which Marid tried to emulate as she grew up. Despite her tough shell, though, she genuinely cares about her ward and has a mini breakdown in Day Three when Marid nearly dies.

Initially she serves a questgiver role and gives the player direction while they're finding their feet. She's a little too active and competent for a mentor, and would usurp the story from Marid if she could, so she ends up incapacitated and forced to serve a support role halfway through the game.

Doctor Cavala's name comes from the Latin "caballa" / French "cavalier." The goblin forewoman references this, calling her a "warhorse."]

Doctor Cavala is a woman.
The scent is "[if time is critical]Doctor Cavala is sweating.[otherwise]Doctor Cavala never wears perfume, owing to the danger of contamination during surgery."
Understand "dark-skinned" or "surgeon" or "dr" as Cavala.

Doctor Cavala can be able-bodied or incapacitated. She is able-bodied.

The description of Doctor Cavala is "[first time]You came to know Doctor Cavala when she served with Lumina's volunteers during the troubles. Her clinic was your first choice for apprenticeship when you graduated. Since then you've watched her drag more than a few souls kicking from the brink of death -- and they won't be the last, not if she has anything to say about it.

Doctor Cavala is a dark-skinned surgeon in her early forties, sharp and regal of bearing. [only][cavala-description]".

To say cavala-description:
	if Reden's Surgery is happening:
		say "She circles the gurney with increasing agitation, doing all she can to keep her patient alive. ";
	otherwise if Walking Home in Darkness is happening:
		say "Right now, she appears to be filling out a census report for Reden's death. ";
	otherwise if Reden's Autopsy is happening:
		say "She has a look of absolute concentration on her face. ";
	otherwise if Walking Home in Fear is happening:
		say "She's taking her injury rather well -- but then again, she [italic type]was[roman type] an army doctor. ";
	otherwise if All Quiet on the Western Front is happening:
		if A Crucible Game is happening:
			say "She's looking at her cards with a cool, unreadable expression. ";
		otherwise:
			say "She looks frankly irritated that she's bedridden. ";
	otherwise if Heroes Never Die is happening:
		say "Her eyes are red from crying. ";
	otherwise:
		say "She seems to be at a crossroads, lost in thought. ".
		
Doctor Cavala's leg is a thing.
The description is "[if First Aid on Cavala is happening and Doctor Cavala is wearing the hermetically sealed bandage]You hope the bleeding has subsided.[otherwise if First Aid on Cavala is happening]It's a ragged bloody tear.[otherwise]If Doctor Cavala feels any pain, she doesn't show it."
The scent is "[if First Aid on Cavala is happening]The scent of blood is thick.[otherwise]You smell the calomel in the dressing."
Understand "left" or "thigh/knee/tendon" or "cut/gash/wound/tear/injury" or "blood/bloody/bleeding" or "trouser/trousers" as Doctor Cavala's leg.
Before bandaging Doctor Cavala's leg with, try bandaging Doctor Cavala with the second noun instead.
Instead of taking off Doctor Cavala's leg, say "Taking off Doctor Cavala's trousers might cause more trauma. You have to stop the bleeding first."
Instead of attacking, cutting, knocking on, pushing, pulling, rubbing, squeezing, swinging, taking, touching, or turning Doctor Cavala's leg, say "[if time is critical]This is not the time.[otherwise]That would worsen her injury."

The hermetically sealed bandage is a wearable thing.
The description is "Doctor Cavala's knee has been bandaged tightly."
The scent is "You smell the calomel in the dressing."
Understand "antiseptic" or "dressing" or "bandages" or "calomel" or "solution" or "gauze" or "natron" or "sigil/sigils" or "fabric" as the hermetically sealed bandage.
Instead of attacking, cutting, knocking on, pushing, pulling, looking under, rubbing, squeezing, swinging, taking, touching, or turning the hermetically sealed bandage, say "[if time is critical]This is not the time.[otherwise]The bandage shouldn't be disturbed until a more qualified surgeon arrives. [first time](And Doctor Cavala can't exactly operate on herself.) [only][line break]"
		
Instead of bandaging Doctor Cavala with when Doctor Cavala is wearing the hermetically sealed bandage: say "Doctor Cavala's wound is already bandaged."

Chapter 1.3.3.2 - Horatio

[Horatio began as a throwaway character but has evolved into a contrast to Justinian, the main villain. (Spoilers!) Unlike Justinian, whose ambition leads him to instigate the events of the game, Horatio is just a happy-go-lucky fellow who takes care of Marid and reminds her that she doesn't need some big quest to find happiness in her life.

I'd like to pretend Horatio is named after the character in Hamlet but he was actually named after Horatio Hornblower. There's no real reason for this other than I thought it sounded like a Solphosian name.]

Horatio is an undescribed man.
The description is "[horatio-description]".
The scent is "Horatio smells like sweat and ozone."
Understand "vigile" as Horatio.

To say horatio-description:
	if Cavala's Errands is happening:
		say "Vigile Horatio is a childhood friend of yours. He's always been a bit dense, but you're glad to have him around. ";
	otherwise if Walking Home in Fear is happening:
		say "At least he seems to be making himself useful. ";
	otherwise if All Quiet on the Western Front is happening:
		if A Crucible Game is happening:
			say "Horatio is contemplating his hand of cards. ";
		otherwise:
			say "He looks more bored than anything. ";
	otherwise:
		say "He looks bemused, as though at a loss. ";

Chapter 1.3.3.3 - Carnicer

[Carnicer is the "miniboss" of the first half of the game. A lackey of the antagonist, she provides a sense of urgency in the game's beginning, and lets us toss in some action before Marid really knows what's going on. We also use her to remove Doctor Cavala from the playing field, and to give Marid superpowers from her near-death experience.

Carnicer means "butcher" in Latin.]

Carnicer is an undescribed hostile improper-named mutant woman.
The printed name is "[if Carnicer is improper-named]assassin[otherwise]Carnicer[end if]".
The scent is "The scent of blood."
Understand "hooded" or "assassin" or "killer" or "butcher" or "claw/claws/head" as Carnicer.
Understand "stranger" as Carnicer when Averting Cavala's Assassination is happening.

The description of Carnicer is "[if Rooftop Pursuit has not ended]She's far too close for comfort[otherwise if Midnight has not ended]She is unhurried, like a spider whose prey is in its web[otherwise]Placeholder[end if]."

Carnicer has some text called the faraway response. The faraway response is "You didn't come this far to commit suicide."

Carnicer's blade is an improper-named thing. It is carried by Carnicer.
The printed name is "[Carnicer]'s blade".
The description is "Serrated."
Understand "sword" or "assassin's" as Carnicer's blade.
Does the player mean doing something with Carnicer's blade: it is likely.

Carnicer's smile is an improper-named thing. It is part of Carnicer.
The printed name is "[Carnicer]'s smile".
The description is "You can't look away."
Understand "grin" or "tooth/teeth" or "hood/cloak" or "assassin's" as Carnicer's smile.

Rule for writing a paragraph about Carnicer when Highway to Hell is happening:
	say "In the corridor, the assassin paces back and forth with languor.";

Chapter 1.3.3.4 - Justinian

[Justinian is the main antagonist of the game. He's a dark mirror to Marid: having gone through much of the same navel-gazing and agonizing over death, he's decided that he will be the master of his destiny and turn death into his own personal tool. In killing, he seeks to preserve life.

Justinian has been a difficult character to write because a) we need to preserve the antagonist twist reveal, and b) Marid has a raging fangirl crush on him. This means every interaction with Justinian has had like three layers of meaning.

Justinian is named after Emperor Justinian of the Byzantine Empire, as befitting his ambition.]

Justinian is a human man.
The description is "[justinian-description]".
The scent is "[if time is critical]This is not the time[otherwise]You can't get distracted by his cologne, not now[end if]."
Understand "doctor" or "justin" or "volontis" as Justinian.
Understand "immaculate" or "white" or "coat" or "blood" as Justinian when Day Three has ended.

To say justinian-description:
	if Four Investigations is happening:
		say "His eyes are dark sunsets. ";
	otherwise if Heroes Never Die is happening:
		say "He returns your gaze uneasily. ";
	otherwise if Day Three has ended:
		say "His immaculate white coat is flecked with blood. ";
	otherwise:
		say "You shouldn't look at him. You'll start fantasizing. ";
	
Instead of kissing, rubbing, or touching Justinian:
	if the current action is kissing and Day Three has ended:
		say "It's too late for that now.";
	otherwise if time is critical:
		say "This is not the time.";
	otherwise:
		say "[one of]No. No! No. Yes -- [italic type]No![roman type][line break][or]Absolutely not.[stopping]";
	
Instead of attacking, cutting, or pushing Justinian:
	if time is critical:
		say "This is not the time.";
	otherwise:
		say "[one of]What? No! Why would you even consider that?[or]Absolutely not.[stopping]";

Instead of knocking on, pulling, searching, swinging, squeezing, taking, or turning Justinian:
	if time is critical:
		say "This is not the time.";
	otherwise:
		say "[one of]No. No! That would -- that would be much too forward.[or]You can't bring yourself to.[stopping]";
		
Chapter 1.3.3.5 - Doctor Serpens

[Doctor Serpens is another minor antagonist. He's a corrupt "establishment man" who has agreed to join Justinian's plan for the opportunity to advance his career. Narratively, he serves the purpose of escalating the stakes after Carnicer's death, and provides a decoy villain to mask the twist of Justinian being the antagonist.]

Doctor Serpens is a hostile undescribed human man.
The description is "[serpens-description]".
The scent is "He smells like death."

To say serpens-description:
	if Doctor Serpens is living:
		say "He's moaning, spasming, coughing his own guts up. He will not see another sunrise. ";
	otherwise:
		say "Bits of his soul cling to his flesh the way rotting meat clings to bone. "
		
Instead of kissing, knocking on, pulling, pushing, rubbing, squeezing, swinging, taking, touching, or turning Doctor Serpens, say "You have no intention of sharing his fate."
Instead of searching Doctor Serpens when Doctor Serpens is dead: say "It's too risky. You might expose yourself to the affliction."

Book 1.4 - When Time is Critical, When It is Night, When It is Raining

["When time is critical" - This is used to flag the player at certain tense times so that comedic and relaxed responses don't trigger.]

Book 1.5 - Sounds, Scents

[I want to provide unique descriptions for smelling, listening, and so on. This saves us a lot of instead rules and hopefully cuts down on action-processing time.]

A room has some text called the sound.
A thing has some text called the sound.
A room has some text called the scent.
A thing has some text called the scent.

The report listening rule is not listed in the report listening to rulebook.
The report smelling rule is not listed in the report smelling rulebook.
	
Report listening (this is the new report listening rule):
	if the sound of the noun is not empty:
		say "[sound of the noun][line break]";
	otherwise:
		say "You hear nothing unexpected."

Report smelling (this is the new report smelling rule):
	if the scent of the noun is not empty:
		say "[scent of the noun][line break]";
	otherwise:
		say "You smell nothing unexpected."

Book 1.6 - Faraway Things

[This game has a lot of scenery that you can see but not interact with. This is a tag for those things to consolidate all the instead rules into a single rule.]

A thing can be faraway or non-faraway. A thing is usually non-faraway.

Last instead of doing something (this is the can't generally interact with faraway things rule):
	let N be an object;
	if action requires a touchable noun:
		if the noun is part of a faraway thing (called the parent):
			now N is the parent;
		otherwise if the noun is faraway:
			now N is the noun;
	otherwise if action requires a touchable second noun:
		if the second noun is part of a faraway thing (called the parent):
			now N is the parent;
		otherwise if the second noun is faraway:
			now N is the second noun;
	if N is a thing:
		if we are listening to N, continue the action;
		if we are smelling N and the scent of N is not empty, continue the action;
		if N provides the property faraway response:
			say "[faraway response of N][line break]";
		otherwise:
			say "[They're] too far away.";
	otherwise:
		continue the action.
		
The can't reach inside rooms rule response (A) is "That's too far away."

Book 1.7 - GUI and Vorple

[This source text was created from a development build that makes use of the Vorple interpreter. In the Spring Thing 2021 release, I've removed all references to Vorple and changed the functions to not use Vorple, which is why you see these apparently redundant functions being defined here.]
		
To update status line:
	redraw status line.

Even now, the flowing, circuitous lines remind you of him."

Part 2.2.1 - Key Items

[This marks items that can't be dropped.]

A key-item is a kind of thing.

Section 2.3.2.1.1 - ">" as a Synonym for Looking

[Parser hack courtesy of matt w. He writes:
	
	"What I've done is I've commented out the part of "Reading the Command" that handles "if the line was blank, get a fresh line." Then I use an "After reading a command" rule to handle the case where there's a blank command, by changing the command to what you want. I haven't checked it with undo and "end the story," but it might be safer than trying to hand-roll the turn sequence. Though I daren't ever say that messing with the parser template code is safe."

I use matt w's hack instead of changing the "I beg your pardon" error message so that the game runs all of the appropriate turn sequence code -- including "undo" save states and "end the story" triggers -- which aren't covered by the "rest of the turn rule" in Part 1.1.3.]

Understand "whistle" as a mistake ("[if time is critical]This is not the time.[otherwise]You don't know how to whistle.").
Understand "xyzzy" or "plugh" or "plover" as a mistake ("[if time is critical]This is not the time.[otherwise if Epilogue is happening]You're a doctor, not a wizard.[otherwise]You're a doctor's apprentice, not a wizard's apprentice.").

Part 2.3.4 - New Parser Error Messages

[As a general rule for parser error messages, I want them to be clear about why the command wasn't accepted, and suggest a different course of action that will be more likely to work.]

look-reminder-printed is a truth state that varies.

Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the can't see any such thing error (this is the new can't see any such thing rule):
	if the player's command includes "go/walk/run":
		say "You can only go in compass directions, or up, down, in, or out." instead;
	otherwise:
		say "That is either not important or not something you can see.[line break][if look-reminder-printed is false][line break](Type [begincmd]look[endcmd] or a blank command to examine your surroundings.)";
		now look-reminder-printed is true.
	
Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the not a verb I recognise error or the latest parser error is the didn't understand that number error (this is the new not a verb I recognise rule):
	say "That object or command isn't available[one of].

(Type [begincmd]commands[endcmd] or [begincmd]c[endcmd] for a list of commands.)[or].[stopping]" instead.
	
Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the noun did not make sense in that context error (this is the new did not make sense in that context rule):
	if the player's command includes "go/revisit/return":
		say "That isn't a place you've visited in this game yet[if player-knows-go is false].[paragraph break](Try going in a direction instead. For example, [begincmd]go south[endcmd].)[otherwise]." instead;
	otherwise:
		say "That is either not important or not something you can see.[line break][if look-reminder-printed is false][line break](Type [begincmd]look[endcmd] or a blank command to examine your surroundings.)";
		now look-reminder-printed is true.
	
Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the can't use multiple objects error (this is the new can't use multiple objects rule):
	say "You'll have to specify which one." instead.

Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the can't see whom to talk to error or the latest parser error is the can't talk to inanimate things error or the latest parser error is the can't again the addressee error or the latest parser error is the didn't understand addressee's last name error (this is the new can't see whom to talk to rule):
	say generic TALK TO tutorial instead.

Part 2.3.5 - New Action Behavior

player-knows-look is a truth state that varies.
Before looking when player-knows-look is false (this is the so you do know how to look rule):
	now player-knows-look is true;
	continue the action.

player-knows-go is a truth state that varies.
Before going a direction when player-knows-go is false (this is the so you do know how to go rule):
	now player-knows-go is true;
	continue the action.

After opening (this is the reveal any newly visible interior even if it contains nothing rule):
	if the noun is an opaque container and
		the noun contains nothing and
		the noun does not enclose the actor:
		if the action is not silent, say "[We] [open] [the noun]. [They're] empty.";
	otherwise:
		continue the action.
		
Does the player mean entering something:
	if the noun is not a door and the noun is not enterable, it is unlikely;
	make no decision.

Part 2.3.6 - Implicit Actions

[Marid is a proper lady who closes doors behind her when she walks through them.]

A door can be better kept closed or better left open. A door is usually better kept closed.

After going through a door (called the traversed door) (this is the close doors after going through them rule):
	if the traversed door is openable and the traversed door is better kept closed:
		if the player is staid, say "(closing the door[if the traversed door is plural-named]s[end if] behind you)[command clarification break]";
		try silently closing the traversed door;
	continue the action.
	
Rule for issuing the response text of the opening doors before entering rule response (A) while the player is hurrying (this is the suppress implicit door-opening messages while approaching rule): say "[run paragraph on]".

Part 2.3.7 - Emptying It Into

[An astute player might want to pour out the wine bottle in Sal and Piper's hideout. Since I've implemented the verb, this very lengthy code ensures that "emptying things" works as one might expect in other areas of the game.]

Emptying it into is an action applying to two things.
Understand "empty [something preferably held]" as emptying it into.
Understand "empty [something preferably held] in/into/on/onto/over [something]" as emptying it into.
Understand "empty out [something preferably held]" as emptying it into.
Understand "empty out [something preferably held] in/into/on/onto/over [something]" as emptying it into.
Understand "empty [something preferably held] out" as emptying it into.
Understand "empty [something preferably held] out in/into/on/onto/over [something]" as emptying it into.
Understand "pour [something preferably held]" as emptying it into.
Understand "pour [something preferably held] in/into/on/onto/over [something]" as emptying it into.
Understand "pour out [something preferably held]" as emptying it into.
Understand "pour out [something preferably held] in/into/on/onto/over [something]" as emptying it into.
Understand "pour [something preferably held] out" as emptying it into.
Understand "pour [something preferably held] out in/into/on/onto/over [something]" as emptying it into.

Rule for supplying a missing second noun while emptying (this is the emptying into the location rule):
	now the second noun is the location.

Check emptying (this is the can't empty something that's not a container rule):
	if the noun is not a container:
		say "[The noun] [are]n't something you can empty.";
		stop the action.
		
Check emptying (this is the can't empty something into something that can't enclose things rule):
	if the second noun is not a room and the second noun is not a container and the second noun is not a supporter:
		say "[The second noun] [are]n't something you can empty things into.";
		stop the action.
		
Check emptying (this is the can't empty something that's already empty rule):
	if the noun contains nothing:
		say "[The noun] [are] already empty.";
		stop the action.
		
Check emptying (this is the can't empty something that's closed rule):
	if the noun is closed:
		say "(first opening [the noun])[command clarification break]";
		try silently opening the noun;
	if the noun is closed, stop the action.
	
Carry out emptying (this is the standard emptying rule):
	if the second noun is a supporter:
		now all things in the noun are on the second noun;
	otherwise:
		now all things in the noun are in the second noun.
			
Report emptying (this is the report emptying rule):
	if the second noun is a supporter:
		say "You empty [the noun] onto [the second noun].";
	otherwise:
		say "You empty [the noun] into [the second noun]."
		
Part 2.3.8 - Listing Exits and Going-In Disambiguation

A room has some text called the exit reminder.

Listing exits is an action out of world. Understand "exits" as listing exits.
Instead of going nowhere, try listing exits instead.

Report listing exits (this is the report listing exits rule):
	if the player is engaged in endoscopy:
		say "[exit reminder of the endoscopic location][line break]";
	otherwise:
		say "[exit reminder of the location][line break]".
	
A room has some text called the going-in disambiguation. [When there are multiple possible "ins" the game will ask which you mean.]

First instead of going when the noun is inside and the going-in disambiguation of the location is not empty (this is the provide going-in disambiguation rule):
	say "[going-in disambiguation of the location][line break]".

Part 2.3.9 - Dialogue System

[This game has a lot of talking. I decided to go with Planescape: Torment style multiple choice dialogue because let's be real, ASK/TELL is the least fun topic-guessing gameplay ever devised.]

Chapter 2.3.9.1 - Dialogue Branches

A dialogue branch is a kind of object.

A dialogue branch has a truth state called enabled. Enabled is usually true. [If a branch is not enabled, it doesn't show up as a possible choice in the command prompt.]

A dialogue branch has a truth state called one-shot. One-shot is usually false. [A one-shot branch disables itself after being read out.]

A dialogue branch has some text called the prompt. The prompt of a dialogue branch is usually "[printed name] (no prompt)". [The prompt is the text that labels the option to choose the branch.]

A dialogue branch has some text called the description. [The description is the text displayed when the branch is chosen.]

A dialogue branch has a list of dialogue branches called the choices. [These are the child branches of the branch.]

A person has a dialogue branch called the home dialogue branch. [This flag indicates the default branch when you TALK TO someone.]

The null dialogue branch is a dialogue branch. The home dialogue branch of a person is usually the null dialogue branch. [A placeholder to prevent runtime errors due to not defining dialogue for someone.] The description of the null dialogue branch is "[bold type]Error:[roman type] Attempted to read out null dialogue branch."

[If a branch has no children, it will end the dialogue upon being read out.]

Wait for any key before prompt switch is a truth state that varies. [This is switched on when we want to wait for any key before providing the command prompt.]

Look-pending switch is a truth state that varies. [This is switched on when we want to look after ending a dialogue.]

To say wait for any key before prompt:
	now the wait for any key before prompt switch is true.

To say look pending:
	follow the scene changing rules;
	now look-pending switch is true;
	wait for any key.

Chapter 2.3.9.2 - Tearing Out Inform Dialogue

Understand the commands "ask" and "tell" and "say" and "answer" and "yes" and "no" and "sorry" as something new.

Understand "ask [text]" or "tell [text]" or "answer [text]" or "say [text]" or "insult [text]" or "compliment [text]" or "flirt [text]" or "greet [text]" or "whisper [text]" or "wave at/to [text]" or "report [text]" or "hello" or "hi" or "ok" or "okay" or "nod" or "shake head" or "wave" or "yes" or "no" or "sorry" as a mistake ("[generic TALK TO tutorial]").

Understand "wave hello" or "wave hello [text]" or "wave goodbye" or "wave goodbye [text]" as a mistake ("[generic TALK TO tutorial]"). [Because OF COURSE wxd tried this]

Instead of asking someone to try doing something, say generic TALK TO tutorial.
Instead of answering someone that something, say generic TALK TO tutorial.

To say generic TALK TO tutorial:
	say "(Use the command [begincmd]talk to[endcmd] or [begincmd]t[endcmd] to converse with other characters.) "

Chapter 2.3.9.3 - Engaged in Dialogue

[This is the flag that changes the way the interface is presented while you're talking to someone. I'm not sure why I made it a property of the player but hey, if it works...]

Yourself can be engaged in dialogue. Yourself is not engaged in dialogue.

The available dialogue choices is a list of dialogue branches that varies.

Reading out something is an activity on dialogue branches. [This activity is what translates the dialogue branch object into displayed text and provides the appropriate dialogue choices. We make it an activity rather than a function so we can write "Before reading out X..." or "After reading out X..."]

To read out (current branch - a dialogue branch):
	carry out the reading out activity with the current branch. [A more convenient and human-readable way to say the same thing.]
	
Rule for reading out a dialogue branch (called the current branch):
	say "[description of the current branch][if the description of the current branch is not empty and look-pending switch is false][line break]";
	if the one-shot of the current branch is true, now the enabled of the current branch is false;
			
Last after reading out a dialogue branch (called the current branch) (this is the set dialogue choices or end the dialogue rule): [This is separated from the main 'reading out' rule because the 'after reading out' rules may change the conditions of a scene change or what dialogue choices are available.]
	change the available dialogue choices to have 0 entries;
	repeat with current child running through the choices of current branch:
		if the enabled of current child is true, add current child to the available dialogue choices;
	if the number of entries in the available dialogue choices is 0:
		end the dialogue; 		
	
Chapter 2.3.9.4 - Dialogue Command Prompt

First before reading a command when the player is engaged in dialogue:
	if the number of entries in the available dialogue choices is 0:
		say "[bold type]Error:[roman type] Attempted to print the dialogue command prompt with no available choices. Now ending the dialogue...[line break]";
		end the dialogue;
	otherwise:
		if the wait for any key before prompt switch is true:
			wait for any key;
			now the wait for any key before prompt switch is false;
		
To say dialogue command prompt:
	say italic type;
	repeat with N running from 1 to the number of entries in the available dialogue choices:
		say "[N]) [prompt of entry N in the available dialogue choices]";
		say line break;
	say roman type;
	say line break;
	say standard command prompt;
	
After reading a command while the player is engaged in dialogue (this is the reading a command during dialogue rule):
	if the player's command matches "[number]":
		let N be the number understood;
		if N > 0 and N <= the number of entries in the available dialogue choices:
			read out entry N in the available dialogue choices;
			reject the player's command;
			stop;
	unless the player's command matches "quit/q/save/restore/load/restart":
		say "Please choose a response from the list by typing the corresponding number.";
		reject the player's command.

First turn sequence rule (this is the time doesn't pass during dialogue rule):
	if the player is engaged in dialogue, rule fails.

Chapter 2.3.9.5 - Starting and Ending a Dialogue

To start a dialogue with (provided partner - a thing):
	if the home dialogue branch of the provided partner is not the null dialogue branch:
		now the conversational partner text is "Talking to [the provided partner]";
		now the command prompt is "[dialogue command prompt]";
		if the number of characters in the conversational partner text is greater than 14, now right alignment depth is the number of characters in the conversational partner text;
		read out the home dialogue branch of the provided partner;
		now the player is engaged in dialogue;
	otherwise:
		say "[bold type]Error:[roman type] Attempted to start a dialogue with [the provided partner] but no home dialogue branch was defined for [them]."
		
To start a dialogue using dialogue (chatter - a dialogue branch):
	now the conversational partner text is "[if the current day is Prologue or the current day is Epilogue][otherwise][current day]";
	now the command prompt is "[dialogue command prompt]";
	if the number of characters in the conversational partner text is greater than 14, now right alignment depth is the number of characters in the conversational partner text;
	read out the chatter;
	now the player is engaged in dialogue.
		
To start a dialogue saying (provided text - some text) using dialogue (chatter - a dialogue branch):
	now the conversational partner text is the provided text;
	now the command prompt is "[dialogue command prompt]";
	if the number of characters in the conversational partner text is greater than 14, now right alignment depth is the number of characters in the conversational partner text;
	read out the chatter;
	now the player is engaged in dialogue.

To start a dialogue with (provided partner - a thing) using dialogue (chatter - a dialogue branch):
	now the conversational partner text is "Talking to [the provided partner]";
	now the command prompt is "[dialogue command prompt]";
	if the number of characters in the conversational partner text is greater than 14, now right alignment depth is the number of characters in the conversational partner text;
	read out the chatter;
	now the player is engaged in dialogue.
	
To end the dialogue, without advancing time:
	now the conversational partner text is "";
	now the command prompt is "[standard command prompt]";
	now right alignment depth is 14;
	now the player is not engaged in dialogue;
	if not without advancing time:
		if look-pending switch is true, try looking;
		now look-pending switch is false;
		now ambience suppression is true;
		follow the rest of the turn rule.

Chapter 2.3.9.6 - Talking To

Talking to is an action applying to one visible thing.
Understand "talk to [someone]" as talking to. [So the first disambiguation response with no noun is "Who do you want to talk to?"]
Understand "talk to/with/-- [something]" as talking to.
Understand "holler at [something]" as talking to.
Understand "scream at [something]" as talking to.
Understand "shout at [something]" as talking to.
Understand "speak to/with/-- [something]" as talking to.
Understand "yell at [something]" as talking to.
Understand "t [something]" as talking to.

Does the player mean talking to a person: it is likely.

First check talking to something that is not a living person (this is the can't talk to inanimate objects rule): say "You won't get much of a response." instead.

Check talking to the player (this is the can't talk to yourself rule): say "You aren't that far gone, Marid." instead.

Check talking to an other person when the home dialogue branch of the noun is the null dialogue branch (this is the can't talk to someone with no home dialogue rule): say "[The noun] [have] nothing to say to you." instead.

Check talking to an other person when the enabled of the home dialogue branch of the noun is false (this is the can't talk to someone with disabled home dialogue rule): say "[The noun] [have] nothing to say to you." instead.

Carry out talking to something (this is the standard talking to rule):
	start a dialogue with the noun.

Part 2.3.10 - Endoscopy

[This is a minigame where we "transport" the player's perspective inside the pathway they inspect. We clear the screen and shift perspective to the endoscope-viewpoint. You can "look," "go," or "examine" a thing in the endoscopic room. Any other action ends the endoscopy.

Yes, I know that reusing the same endoscope is super gross. It's fantasy magical sterilization or something.]

Chapter 2.3.10.1 - Definitions

Yourself can be engaged in endoscopy. Yourself is not engaged in endoscopy.

The endoscopic location is a room that varies.

The endoscopic subject text is some text that varies.

The endoscopic-endoscope is a privately-named backdrop.
The printed name is "light from your endoscope".
The description is "A circle of feeble illumination."
Understand "ring/circle" or "of/from" or "your/my" or "light/lens-light/illumination" or "lens/lenses" or "endoscope/scope" as the endoscopic-endoscope.

Chapter 2.3.10.2 - Endoscopic Actions

After deciding the scope of the player while the player is engaged in endoscopy:
	place the endoscopic location in scope;
	place the endoscopic-endoscope in scope.

Does the player mean doing something with a thing enclosed by the endoscopic location when the player is engaged in endoscopy: it is very likely.
Does the player mean doing something with the endoscopic-endoscope when the player is engaged in endoscopy: it is very likely.
Rule for clarifying the parser's choice of something when the player is engaged in endoscopy: do nothing.
	
Last before doing anything when the player is engaged in endoscopy (this is the endoscopic actions rule):
	if we are looking:
		say "[bold type][printed name of the endoscopic location in title case][roman type][line break][run paragraph on with special look spacing]";
		if set to abbreviated room descriptions:
			do nothing;
		otherwise if set to sometimes abbreviated room descriptions and abbreviated form allowed is true and the endoscopic location is visited:
			do nothing;
		otherwise:
			say "[description of the endoscopic location][line break]";
		if the endoscopic location is a room, now the endoscopic location is visited;
		stop the action;
	[A caveat for looking: this is a short-form hack that doesn't describe the locale, so we have to describe all the scenery in the room description. I could make it describe the locale if I wanted to but that is a lot of effort and code for no real gain.]
	otherwise if we are going:
		if the noun is outside:
			end the endoscopy, followed by looking;
			stop the action;
		otherwise if the noun is inside:
			now the noun is down;
		if the room the noun from the endoscopic location is a room:
			if the noun is up:
				say "You withdraw...[paragraph break]";
			otherwise if the noun is down:
				say "You descend...[paragraph break]";
			wait for any key;
			clear only the main screen;
			say line break;
			now the endoscopic location is the room the noun from the endoscopic location;
			update backdrop positions;
			surreptitiously reckon darkness;
			try looking;
			stop the action;
		otherwise if the noun is up:
			end the endoscopy, followed by looking;
			stop the action;
		otherwise if the noun is down:
			say "You cannot go any further.";
			stop the action;
		otherwise:
			say "You can only go up or down.";
			stop the action;
	otherwise if we are descending:
		continue the action;
	otherwise if we are exiting:
		end the endoscopy, followed by looking;
		stop the action;
	otherwise if we are doing something with a thing (called the curiosity) enclosed by the endoscopic location:
		if we are searching or looking under:
			try examining the noun;
			stop the action;
		otherwise if we are examining:
			continue the action;
		otherwise:
			say "You can only examine [regarding the curiosity][them].";
			stop the action;
	otherwise if the current action involves the endoscopic-endoscope:
		if we are searching or looking under:
			try examining the noun;
			stop the action;
		otherwise if we are examining:
			continue the action;
		otherwise if we are pulling or taking:
			try going up;
			stop the action;
		otherwise if we are pushing or dropping:
			try going down;
			stop the action;
		otherwise if we are opening, closing, knocking on, squeezing, swinging, touching, tickling, or turning:
			say "You adjust the lenses.";
			stop the action;
		otherwise:
			say "You cannot do that.";
			stop the action;
	otherwise if we are examining down or examining inside:
		say "You see only darkness.";
		stop the action;
	otherwise if we are examining a direction:
		say "The endoscope is not articulated enough to do that.";
		stop the action;
	otherwise if we are waiting:
		say "You adjust the lenses.";
		stop the action;
	otherwise:
		end the endoscopy;
		continue the action.
		
[Since the before stage doesn't run for out of world actions, this still allows saving, loading, asking for help, and so on.]
		
endoscopy-exit-tutorial-quipped is a truth state that varies.
	
To quip the endoscopy exit tutorial:
	if endoscopy-exit-tutorial-quipped is false:
		say "[line break](Type [begincmd]out[endcmd] to end the endoscopy.)";
		now endoscopy-exit-tutorial-quipped is true.

Chapter 2.3.10.3 - Starting and Ending an Endoscopy

endoscopy-tutorial-quipped is a truth state that varies.

To start an endoscopy on (victim name - some text) via (the aperture - some text) to (destination - a room):
	say "You insert the endoscope into [the aperture]...[paragraph break]";
	wait for any key;
	now the player is engaged in endoscopy;
	now the endoscopic location is the destination;
	now the endoscopic subject text is "Inspecting [victim name]";
	if the number of characters in the endoscopic subject text is greater than 14, now right alignment depth is the number of characters in the endoscopic subject text;
	clear the screen;
	update status line;
	say line break;
	try looking.
	
To end the endoscopy, followed by looking:
	say "You withdraw upward...[paragraph break]";
	wait for any key;
	now the player is not engaged in endoscopy;
	now right alignment depth is 14;
	clear the screen;
	update status line;
	say line break;
	say "You clean the endoscope and put it in your pocket.[paragraph break]";
	if followed by looking, try looking.

To say about-this-game-text:
	say "[bold type]About this game[roman type]

[italic type]The Weight of a Soul[roman type] is a passion project that I've been working on for the past five years. It's a long and ambitious interactive novel inspired by classics like [italic type]Anchorhead[roman type], [italic type]Blue Lacuna[roman type], and [italic type]City of Secrets[roman type]. It began as a side project, when I thought to myself: 'I'll work on something small and simple, like a text adventure.' As it turns out, text adventures aren't such small and simple projects after all.

An early excerpt of this game was shown at Spring Thing 2017 in the Back Garden category. Since then, I've spent much of my spare time finishing and polishing the game. This is the Spring Thing 2021 version of the game, a public release where the interactive novel is playable in its entirety. An average playthrough has over 50,000 words and may take five to six hours to complete; there are seven possible endings that can be achieved. (See if you can find them all.)

While [italic type]The Weight of a Soul[roman type] is complete, I don't consider it finished by any means. I'm working on an improved version of the novel with updated prose and a modern user interface, which I plan to release as a 'premium edition' on itch.io and Steam. For more information, see the game's web page here: [bold type]https://chinkeeyong.wordpress.com/the-weight-of-a-soul/[roman type]

This game was written and compiled in Inform 7. More information can be found at [bold type]inform7.com[roman type].";

	say "[bold type]How to play[roman type]

This is a work of interactive fiction. It is a game about investigating mysteries and solving puzzles. You play the part of Marid, a doctor's apprentice, and your actions in the coming days could determine the fate of the Channelworks District.

The > symbol indicates a command prompt. When a > is displayed, you can type commands for Marid to follow, in the form [begincmd]go west[endcmd] or [begincmd]take lantern[endcmd], and she will go along as far as she is able and willing. Type [begincmd]commands[endcmd] or [begincmd]c[endcmd] for a list of commands.

If you are talking to someone, you will instead be prompted to choose from a list of possible responses, in the form [italic type]'1) Say hello; 2) Say goodbye.'[roman type] In this case, you should choose one of the responses by typing the corresponding number.

At other times, there may be no command prompt provided at all, such as during a dramatic pause in the text. When this happens, press any key to continue.";

[italic type]The Weight of a Soul[roman type] was written by Chin Kee Yong a.k.a. CKY, a Singaporean game designer. It is my first serious foray into interactive fiction. My website can be found at [bold type]https://chinkeeyong.wordpress.com/[roman type].

Thanks to my university mentor, Ben Slater, for providing lots of useful comments and guidance.

Thanks to everyone who's ever given feedback on this game: Brian, EC, Emily, Gabriel, G_L, Kenneth, Lewis, Liangdeng, Luel, Mabbu, MathBrush, Miss G, Mown, Niklor, Nommy, Samuel, Sarah, Qingxiang, Wei Ling, the folks at Rotten Mage, and probably a whole host whose names escape me (sorry!). Your time has helped to make this game better. Any bugs in the game are my fault and not the fault of these amazing people.

Thanks to Lieu, Gu, Wen, WY, GA, and the rest for putting up with my fits of manic inspiration. Thanks also to the co-creators and stewards of the Expanded Multiverse: your creativity and positivity are what inspire me to keep going.

Shanflower drew the map of the Channelworks District. Emily Short wrote some extensions that do backstage work for [italic type]The Weight of a Soul[roman type]. Matt W. helped with some programming tricks. Andrew Plotkin designed the Quixe JavaScript interpreter, which the online version of this game uses.[paragraph break]";
	say "Thanks to my family, the Inform team, the Singaporean game development community, and the IF community. And of course, thank you, dear player. I hope you enjoy the game I've made.

To say general-hints-text:
	say "[bold type]General hints for play[roman type]

[italic type]The Weight of the Soul[roman type] is a game about investigation and problem-solving. Take your time and examine your surroundings, especially things that seem out of place or things that could be connected to the greater mystery at hand. Don't be afraid to ask around, explore, and get your hands dirty. Only look at hints if you're completely stuck and need guidance.

Marid is a capable and perceptive protagonist, and she usually has a good idea of where to go next. The Journal shows your current objective, a list of clues you've found, and Marid's thoughts on the situation. You can also consult Characters to refresh your memory on important personages you've encountered, or Map or Places for an overview of the Channelworks District.

[italic type]The Weight of a Soul[roman type] is a very forgiving game. (It's rated 'Polite' on the Zarfian Cruelty Scale, if you know what that is.) Nevertheless, some sections of it have deadly time limits, and it [italic type]is[roman type] possible for the story to end badly for Marid. It is recommended to [begincmd]save[endcmd] if you find yourself in a dire situation. If you get a game over, you can [begincmd]undo[endcmd] a few times to retrace your steps and try again.";

Table of Hydraulic Door Puzzle Hints
hint	used
"You need to open the hydraulic door to see what's inside."	a number
"The gauge on the door says that the pressure isn't within safety limits. The memo on the console says it's a 'pressure safety lock.'"
"In other words, if the pressure is within safety limits, the door should open."
"The nearby console seems to control the pressure. Try pushing and pulling some pistons and see what happens."
"If a piston is retracted (pushed in), it increases the water pressure. If a piston is extended (pulled out), the water pressure decreases."
"The pistons are marked in Roman numerals, and the higher-numbered pistons seem to have a greater effect on the pressure."
"(If you don't know Roman numerals, you can have Marid examine each piston and she will tell you what number the marking represents.)"
"Think of this as a number puzzle. Each piston corresponds to a number (the one it's marked with). You need to find the right sum of numbers that corresponds to the pressure needed to unlock the door."
"Since the door tells you if the sum is too high or too low, you can guess different numbers and make the pistons total those numbers. The more guesses you make, the more clues you will have about the total you need to reach."
"You need to make the pistons add up to 9."
"Some quick arithmetic tells you that 2 + 7 = 9."
"So if the II and VII pistons are retracted and the other pistons are extended, the door will open."

Table of Noctis Storage Hiding Hints
hint	used
"You need to hide before the doctor catches you snooping around."	a number
"You can't hide in the shadows or behind the vats. You need a hiding place isolated enough that Doctor Serpens won't see you walking around."

I don't have the answers. I never have. Perhaps they were never there to be found.

This is all too much for someone like me to think about. I can only hope that when I remember this moment -- when I open my memoirs and recall the terrible events of this day -- I will remember that I made the right decision. ";

I thought I was over him -- I'd been for a long time -- but his memory still fills me with a kind of painful longing. [if ending-agreed-with-justinian-premise is false]He was perhaps my greatest failure... a mark of my own hypocrisy, and a reminder of all the people I couldn't save[otherwise]I know how silly it is to pine for something that could never have been... but I still feel as though something precious was lost on that day[end if].

Looking back, my experiences seem almost too incredible to be true; and yet I cannot deny that what happened to me was real. It's left its mark on the world around me, and it haunts me wherever I go, in the corner of my second sight. When I go to bed at night, sometimes I still [italic type]see[roman type] him beneath my eyelids, calling out to me with those fiery eyes...

[if ending-agreed-with-justinian-premise is false]In another life, perhaps, things could be different. But it's all in the past now. All I can do now is try my best to save lives. To live up to the promise that I made to my father... to Doctor Cavala... to myself[otherwise]Perhaps you were right, Justinian. In the end, I took the easy way out, just as you did. I couldn't escape the circle of life and death. But I told you, on that day, that until I lost every ounce of hope I would continue to fight.

I'm still fighting, Justinian. I owe you that much[end if]. ";

In a way, I only have myself to blame. I've always had the key to saving the district in the palm of my hand. If the Vigiles knew what I knew, if they saw in Justinian what I saw, so many lives would be saved -- but I can't bring myself to tell them. I can't incriminate him. I keep clinging to the hope that he can be saved, that my choice won't have been in vain.

Perhaps I really am an idiot. He certainly thinks I am. [if ending-agreed-with-justinian-premise is false]It takes a special kind of idiot to cling to an ideal to the point of hurting others... to condemn so many because I couldn't end the life of someone I cared about. Is it dumb to hope? To listen to your heart and believe that your faith will be rewarded[otherwise]It takes a special kind of idiot to see the world as it is and believe that things can be different... that you can save the world without ending the life of someone you care about. But what if I wasn't? What if there's still kindness left in his heart -- still hope left in this corpse of a city[end if]?

I want to believe. I really do. Primes forgive me.

[if ending-agreed-with-justinian-premise is false]In another life, perhaps, things could be different. But it's all in the past now. All I can do now is try my best to minimize the harm that Justinian does in the world. I have to live up to the promise that I made to my father... to Doctor Cavala... to myself[otherwise]Perhaps you were right, Justinian. In the end, I was the same as all the others. I didn't have it in me to take the final step. But I told you, on that day, that until I lost every ounce of hope I would continue to fight.

I'm still fighting, Justinian. I owe you that much[end if]. ";
	otherwise if Usurper Ending is happening:
		say "I thought about Justinian again today.

It's funny... when I picture his face, I still feel that flush. That shyness. That heartbreak. I feel like I'm seventeen years old all over again, and Justinian is showing me how to live. I thought I was over him, but evidently I haven't moved on as much as I'd imagined. 

In many ways, Justinian was a visionary. He showed me that there was a better way to do good. He showed me that we should not treat the symptoms but the cause. In my one year as a Doctor, I have achieved more than Cavala could ever have dreamed of.

It's such a pity that he was blinded by his flaws. He was sloppy. Too passionate. He ended up harming the district more than he helped it. And for someone like Justinian -- someone who thinks himself above the law, and justified in causing whatever suffering he wishes -- there was only one fate, regardless of my personal feelings for him.

A city can only have one magistrate, Justinian. I saw that in the Channelworks control tower all those months ago. Perhaps if you'd seen that too, and repented, you would still be by my side. ";

Volume 3 - The Channelworks District

[The Channelworks District was designed to be a microcosm of Furopolis. I wanted the game to highlight many facets of the same city: rich vs. poor, magitech vs. improvised materials, lawful vs. unlawful. The four quarters of the Channelworks District were designed to evoke that.

I had a canal run through the district and define it because I think canals are cool.]

Part 3.1.3 - Ambience

[This part governs random events that sometimes trigger in various areas, to create a sense of liveliness in the Channelworks District. There are a number of backdrop objects which can be placed in rooms to provide them with ambience. The actual ambience text is provided by tables which we shuffle and cycle through in random order.]

An ambience object is a kind of backdrop.
An ambience object can be active or inactive. An ambience object is usually active.
An ambience object has a table name called the associated table.
An ambience object has a number called the message index. The message index is usually 1.

The ambience cooldown timer is a number that varies. The ambience cooldown timer is 3.

Ambience suppression is a truth state that varies.

When play begins (this is the shuffle the ambience rule):
	sort the Table of Day One Upper Perioch ambience in random order;
	sort the Table of Day Two Upper Perioch ambience in random order;
	sort the Table of Day One Riggertown ambience in random order.

Every turn (this is the ambience rule):
	if ambience suppression is false:
		if an active ambience object is in the location:
			decrement the ambience cooldown timer;
			if the ambience cooldown timer is 0:
				now the ambience cooldown timer is a random number from 3 to 4;
				let the relevant ambience be a random active ambience object in the location;
				say the happening in row message index of the relevant ambience of associated table of the relevant ambience;
				say line break;
				increment the message index of the relevant ambience;
				if the message index of the relevant ambience is greater than the number of rows in the associated table of the relevant ambience:
					now the message index of the relevant ambience is 1;
					sort the associated table of the relevant ambience in random order;
	otherwise:	
		now ambience suppression is false.
		
First report going (this is the suppress ambience when entering a room for the first time rule):
	if the location is unvisited:
		now ambience suppression is true.

Instead of searching the gurney, say "You find nothing useful in the mechanical drawers."

Instead of taking an other person on the gurney, say "[regarding the noun]You don't think you should disturb [them]."
Instead of putting something on the gurney when someone is on the gurney, say "[The random person on the gurney] [are] already on the gurney."

Part 3.2.4 - Reden

Reden is a goblin man on the gurney. 
The scent is "[if Reden is living]He reeks.[otherwise if Reden is on the gurney]He's going to have to be embalmed soon.[otherwise]He smells of embalming fluid."
The sound is "[if Reden is living]Hacking, gurgling, wheezing.[otherwise]He is silent."
Understand "patient" as Reden.
Understand "chest" or "cavity" or "autopsy" as Reden when Reden's Autopsy is happening.

To say reden-gurney-description:
	if Reden is living:
		say "The patient[first time], Reden -- he[only] shudders against his straps on the gurney, black blood streaming from his eyes and mouth, even as Doctor Cavala fights to isolate the infection";
		now Doctor Cavala is mentioned;
	otherwise:
		say "Reden lies on the gurney, lifeless and still";
	now Reden is mentioned.

The description of Reden is "[if Reden is living]Reden, goblin male aged 37, stumbled into the clinic six minutes ago suffering from convulsions and phantom pains. Now his life is in Doctor Cavala's hands -- and yours.[otherwise if Reden's Autopsy is happening]His chest cavity has been dissected, revealing a spiderweb pattern of blackened blood vessels and tissues.[otherwise]Black stains run down his cheeks like tears."

Instead of bandaging Reden with, say "It's a little late for that."

Some streams of black blood are part of Reden.
The description is "A chilling symptom. It's unlike any affliction you've ever studied."
Understand "fluid/effluvium" or "stream" or "stain/stains" or "spiderweb" or "pattern" or "blackened" or "vessel/vessels/artery/arteries/arterial" or "tissue/tissues" or "drop/drops/droplet/droplets" as the streams of black blood.
Instead of doing anything other than examining or rubbing with the streams of black blood, say "The fluid could be contagious. You shouldn't interact carelessly with it."
Instead of doing anything when the second noun is the streams of black blood, say "The fluid could be contagious. You shouldn't interact carelessly with it."

Part 3.2.5 - Surgery Room during Prologue

Doctor Cavala is in the Surgery Room.

When play begins (this is the print the introduction rule):
	clear the screen;
	say paragraph break;
	say "Too fast. It all happened too fast.[run paragraph on]";
	wait for any key;
	say "[paragraph break]He was healthy not a day before, or so he said when he stumbled into the clinic just minutes ago.

	wait for any key;
	say "[paragraph break]The vomiting came first, then the weakness of the knees -- you barely caught him as he keeled over you -- Doctor Cavala seized him before you were crushed by his weight. 'The surgery room!' she shouted, and together you half-carried half-dragged the goblin to the gurney and strapped him down.

first-message-and-help-text-shown is a truth state that varies.

Before reading a command while first-message-and-help-text-shown is false (this is the print the first surgical procedure message and new player help text rule):

Chapter 3.2.5.1 - Reden's Surgical Procedure

[This is a minigame where you help Doctor Cavala find stuff for the procedure, potentially prolonging Reden's life. He dies either way, but it's good for atmosphere.]

The CSORSP [current step of Reden's surgical procedure] is a number that varies. The CSORSP is 1.

A purely-surgical-necessity is a kind of thing. [These things will be removed from play when Reden's Surgery ends.]
A purely-surgical-necessity is always worth-taking.
A purely-surgical-necessity has some text called the terse appellation.
Instead of doing anything when the noun is a purely-surgical-necessity or the second noun is a purely-surgical-necessity:
	if the action name part of the current action is:
		-- the examining action: continue the action;
		-- the pulling action: continue the action;
		-- the removing it from action: continue the action;
		-- the taking action: continue the action;
	say "You don't have time for that."

The Reden's surgery holding zone is a container. [This holds surgical necessities that are ready to go on stage when Marid examines the appropriate thing.]

Every turn during Reden's Surgery (this is the Reden's surgical procedure minigame rule):
	choose row CSORSP in the Table of Reden's Surgical Procedure;
	if there is no item required entry:
		advance Reden's surgical procedure;
	otherwise if the Table of Reden's Agonizing Demise is not empty:
		choose a random row in the Table of Reden's Agonizing Demise;
		say "[happening entry][paragraph break]";
		blank out the whole row.

To advance Reden's surgical procedure:
	increase the CSORSP by 1;
	choose row CSORSP in the Table of Reden's Surgical Procedure;
	say "[happening entry][paragraph break]";
	if there is a spawned items entry:
		repeat with current item running through the spawned items entry:
			now the current item is in the Reden's surgery holding zone.
			
Report asking for help during Reden's Surgery (this is the show message after help menu rule):
	choose row CSORSP in the Table of Reden's Surgical Procedure;
	if there is no item required entry:
		say "[happening entry][paragraph break]";
		
Report asking for commands during Reden's Surgery (this is the show message after commands menu rule):

'Fine!' Doctor Cavala says. 'We'll do this without anaesthetic, one way or another.' She squints at Reden's body. 'Marid, get me the stethoscope.'

Chapter 3.2.5.4 - What Not to Do During Life-and-Death Surgery

Instead of talking to Doctor Cavala during Reden's Surgery:
	if there is an item required in row CSORSP of the Table of Reden's Surgical Procedure:
		say "Doctor Cavala asked you to find [the terse appellation of the item required in row CSORSP of the Table of Reden's Surgical Procedure] and give it to her.";
	otherwise:
		say "[run paragraph on]".
		
Instead of waiting during Reden's Surgery, say "[run paragraph on]".
Instead of listening to the Surgery Room during Reden's Surgery, say "[run paragraph on]".
Instead of listening to Doctor Cavala during Reden's Surgery, say "[run paragraph on]".

Instead of switching off the lamps during Reden's Surgery, say "But a surgery is in progress."

Instead of going from the Surgery Room during Reden's Surgery, say "Doctor Cavala has not given up hope, and neither should you."

Instead of doing anything other than examining or listening to Reden during Reden's Surgery, say "You can't disturb the patient at this critical juncture."
Instead of doing anything when the second noun is Reden during Reden's Surgery, say "You can't disturb the patient at this critical juncture."

Instead of doing anything other than examining or listening to Doctor Cavala during Reden's Surgery, say "You can't disturb Doctor Cavala, not now."
Instead of doing anything other than giving something to something when the second noun is Doctor Cavala during Reden's Surgery, say "You can't disturb Doctor Cavala, not now."

Part 3.2.6 - Surgery Room during Heroes Never Die

When Heroes Never Die begins (this is the spawn the Heroes Never Die stuff in the surgery room rule):
	now the thousand pulsing dimensions are in the Surgery Room;
	now the spectral afterimages are in the Surgery Room;
	now Reden's animus is in the Surgery Room.

When Heroes Never Die ends (this is the despawn the freaky Heroes Never Die stuff in the surgery room rule):
	now the thousand pulsing dimensions are nowhere;
	now the spectral afterimages are nowhere.

Some thousand pulsing dimensions are a faraway scenery thing.
The description is "Echoes? Imprints?"
The thousand pulsing dimensions have some text called the faraway response. The faraway response of the thousand pulsing dimensions is "Your head hurts just thinking about that."
Understand "dimension" or "chamber" or "illuminated" as the thousand pulsing dimensions.

Some spectral afterimages are a faraway scenery thing.
The description is "They have the shapes of people. Almost."
The spectral afterimages have some text called the faraway response. The faraway response of the spectral afterimages is "You're not sure you want to."
Understand "afterimage" or "image" or "specter/spectre/specters/spectres" or "edge" or "of/-- vision" as the spectral afterimages.
Instead of talking to the spectral afterimages, say "You know, somehow, that they would not hear you."

Reden's animus is a ghostly goblin man. "You can sense Reden's animus lingering here."
The description is "[if Heroes Never Die is happening]He is cracked but somehow whole[otherwise]You focus and his image appears in your mind: shimmering, shattered, with black-blooded eyes[end if]."
The scent is "He smells of alcohol and death."
Understand "Reden" or "patient" or "fractured/shattered/cracked" or "cracks" or "shimmering" or "apparition" as Reden's animus.

Reden's ghostly eyes are part of Reden's animus.
The description is "His eyes gaze into infinity."
Understand "black" or "his" as Reden's ghostly eyes.
Does the player mean doing something with Reden's ghostly eyes: it is very likely.

Instead of going south when the location is the Surgery Room and Heroes Never Die is happening:
	say "[one of]You briefly consider turning around and walking right back out. But no[or]You have to see this through[stopping].";
	
Instead of talking to Reden's animus when Heroes Never Die is happening:
	start a dialogue with Reden's animus using dialogue reden-hnd-intro.

Chapter 3.3.5.4 - First Aid on Cavala

[This is a multi-step procedure similar to Reden's surgery.]

The CSOFAOC [current step of first aid on Cavala] is a number that varies.

Section 3.3.5.4.1 - Cavala First Aid Dialogue

Some dialogue branches are defined by the Table of Cavala First Aid Dialogue.

Table of Cavala First Aid Dialogue
dialogue branch	enabled	one-shot	prompt	description	choices
cavala-firstaid-home	true	false	""	""	{cavala-firstaid-doctor, cavala-firstaid-ohprimes}

'Be quiet and help me --'

[cavala-firstaid-examinewound]"	{}
cavala-firstaid-ohprimes	true	false	"'Oh Primes...'"	"'Oh Primes...'

[cavala-firstaid-examinewound]"	{}

To say cavala-firstaid-examinewound:
	say "You rush to Doctor Cavala's side. Even from a cursory examination, it's obvious that she needs help, and quickly.

'Hurry,' she says through gritted teeth. 'There's a first aid bag behind the counter...'

[wait for any key](This scene has lethal consequences. You may wish to save the game by typing [begincmd]save[endcmd].) ";

Section 3.3.5.4.2 - Setting the Scene

Rule for writing a paragraph about Doctor Cavala during First Aid on Cavala:
	say "Doctor Cavala is lying on the floor in pain.";
	
Instead of examining Doctor Cavala during First Aid on Cavala: [If for some reason we've never examined Doctor Cavala, this bypasses the suspense-killing initial description of her.]
	if the CSOFAOC is:
		-- 1:
			say "She's bleeding heavily.";
		-- 2:
			say "She's bleeding heavily. You need to dress her leg and bandage it.";
		-- 3:
			say "The bandage is compressing the wound nicely, but you still need to raise her leg above chest level to halt the bleeding.";
	
The galvanic cutter is a faraway thing.
The description is "It looks like the doctor kept a souvenir from her volunteering days."
The scent is "You can still detect the faint smell of ozone."
The galvanic cutter has some text called the faraway response. The faraway response is "It's a cutting tool. You shouldn't be touching it without a good reason."
Understand "lightning" or "cutting" or "tool" as the galvanic cutter.

When First Aid on Cavala begins (this is the initialize First Aid on Cavala rule):
	now the galvanic cutter is carried by Doctor Cavala;
	now Doctor Cavala's leg is part of Doctor Cavala;
	now the first aid bag is described;
	now the CSOFAOC is 1.
	
Section 3.3.5.4.3 - Step 1, Get the First Aid Bag

Instead of talking to Doctor Cavala while the CSOFAOC is 1:
	say "[one of]'Doctor --'

'Get the first aid bag!' she hisses.[or]She doesn't look to be in any state to talk.[stopping]"
	
The first aid bag is a closed openable undescribed container in the Clinic. "A first aid bag is behind the counter."
[It has no description because we want to show its contents and nothing else.]

Does the player mean doing something with the first aid bag when First Aid on Cavala is happening: it is very likely.

Instead of inserting something into the first aid bag:
	if the noun is the antiseptic dressing or the noun is the elastic bandage:
		say "You need that right now.";
	otherwise:
		say "That doesn't belong in the first aid bag."
		
Instead of closing the first aid bag while the first aid bag is open and the CSOFAOC < 3, say "No, you still need the first aid bag."
Instead of emptying the first aid bag into when First Aid on Cavala is happening, say "This is not the time to be making a mess."
	
Instead of doing anything with the first aid bag when Cavala's Errands has not ended (this is the block actions on the first aid bag before First Aid on Cavala rule):
	if we are examining the first aid bag:
		say "A bulky cloth bundle. It's behind the presciption counter.";
	otherwise if we are opening or searching the first aid bag:
		say "You check the contents of the first aid bag. Good -- everything is still intact. You close the bag.";
	otherwise:
		say "You shouldn't meddle with the first aid bag. You never know when it might be needed."
		
Instead of doing anything with the first aid bag when First Aid on Cavala has ended (this is the block actions on the first aid bag after First Aid on Cavala rule):
	if we are examining the first aid bag:
		say "A bulky cloth bundle. It's behind the presciption counter.";
	otherwise if we are opening or searching the first aid bag:
		say "You check the contents of the first aid bag. It looks like there are still enough supplies to last a while. You close the bag.";
	otherwise:
		say "You shouldn't meddle with the first aid bag. You never know when it might be needed again."
		
Before examining, searching, or looking under the prescription counter when the CSOFAOC is 1:
	say "There it is.[paragraph break]";
	try taking the first aid bag instead.

Instead of examining, opening, searching, or taking the first aid bag when the CSOFAOC is 1 (this is the getting the first aid bag rule):
	now the first aid bag is carried by the player;
	now the first aid bag is open;
	say "You grab the bag and wrest it open. Inside are a bellows, an aspirator, a stethoscope, a blood pressure gauge, a pair of scissors, a pair of tweezers, a bar of soap, a roll of tape, five vials (containing saline, laudanum, smelling salts, [italic type]aqua vitae[roman type], and tincture-of-resins) --

There. An antiseptic dressing and an elastic bandage.";
	now ambience suppression is true;
	now the CSOFAOC is 2.

Section 3.3.5.4.4 - Step 2, Bandage the Wound

Instead of talking to Doctor Cavala while the CSOFAOC is 2:
	say "[one of]'Just hang on,' you tell the doctor. 'I found a dressing and a bandage. I'm going to try to stop the bleeding...'[or]Never mind talking. You need to bandage the doctor before she bleeds out.[stopping]"

An antiseptic dressing is a key-item in the first aid bag.
The printed name is "dressing".
The description is "You need it to dress Doctor Cavala's leg."
The scent is "The calomel solution is still active."
Understand "calomel" or "solution" or "gauze" as the antiseptic dressing.
Instead of dropping the antiseptic dressing when the antiseptic dressing is carried, say "No. You can't fumble now."
Does the player mean doing something with the antiseptic dressing when First Aid on Cavala is happening: it is very likely.

An elastic bandage is a key-item in the first aid bag.
The printed name is "bandage".
The description is "You need it to bandage Doctor Cavala's leg."
The scent is "It smells a bit musty, but that's the last thing you care about at the moment."
Understand "bandages" or "fabric" as the elastic bandage.
Instead of dropping the elastic bandage when the antiseptic dressing is carried, say "No. You can't fumble now."
Does the player mean doing something with the elastic bandage when First Aid on Cavala is happening: it is very likely.

Some other first aid supplies are a thing in the first aid bag.
Rule for printing the name of the other first aid supplies when the number of things in the first aid bag is 1: say "first aid supplies".
Instead of doing anything with the other first aid supplies, say "You don't need any of the other things right now."
Understand "bellows" or "aspirator" or "stethoscope" or "pair" or "blood pressure" or "gauge" or "of" or "scissors" or "tweezers" or "bar" or "soap" or "roll" or "tape" or "vial/vials" or "saline" or "laudanum" or "aqua" or "vitae" or "smelling" or "salt/salts" or "tincture-of-resins" or "tincture" or "resin/resins" as the other first aid supplies.

Before tying something to when the CSOFAOC is 2 (this is the convert tying to bandaging during First Aid on Cavala rule):
	if Doctor Cavala is the noun, try bandaging Doctor Cavala with the second noun instead;
	if Doctor Cavala's leg is the noun, try bandaging Doctor Cavala with the second noun instead;
	if Doctor Cavala is the second noun, try bandaging Doctor Cavala with the noun instead;
	if Doctor Cavala's leg is the second noun, try bandaging Doctor Cavala with the noun instead.
	
Before putting something on when the CSOFAOC is 2 and (the second noun is Doctor Cavala or the second noun is Doctor Cavala's leg) (this is the convert putting to bandaging during First Aid on Cavala rule):
	try bandaging Doctor Cavala with the noun instead.

Before bandaging Doctor Cavala with when the CSOFAOC is 2 (this is the bandaging works during First Aid on Cavala rule):
	if the second noun is the antiseptic dressing or the second noun is the elastic bandage:
		let L be a list of things;
		if the antiseptic dressing is not carried:
			try silently taking the antiseptic dressing;
			add the antiseptic dressing to L;
		if the elastic bandage is not carried:
			try silently taking the elastic bandage;
			add the elastic bandage to L;
		say "(first taking [L with definite articles])[command clarification break]";
		dress and bandage Doctor Cavala's leg;
		stop the action;
	otherwise:
		say "You need a dressing and a bandage."

First every turn when the CSOFAOC is 2 (this is the automatically bandage Doctor Cavala when materials are gathered rule):
	if the player carries the antiseptic dressing and the player carries the elastic bandage:
		dress and bandage Doctor Cavala's leg.

To dress and bandage Doctor Cavala's leg:
	now the antiseptic dressing is nowhere;
	now the elastic bandage is nowhere;
	say "'There's no debris.' Doctor Cavala's voice is shaking. 'Remember. Apply pressure --'

She cries out as the dressing touches her wound. You force yourself to ignore her gasps, press down hard, loop the bandage tight. And natron sigils flare on the fabric: the wound is sealed.

'Not... not bad,' she croaks, when she has the voice to speak.

[wait for any key]'Can you move?' you ask.

[wait for any key]Her face twitches.

'Primes, it hurts. I... I think my tendon's gone.'

[wait for any key]'You're still bleeding,' you tell her. 'I need to --'

'-- raise my leg above chest level,' she finishes. 'I understand. Do it, Marid. Prop it up on the chair.'";
	now the CSOFAOC is 3;
	now cavala-firstaid-event-timer is 0;
	now Doctor Cavala is wearing the hermetically sealed bandage.

Section 3.3.5.4.5 - Step 3, Raise the Leg

Instead of talking to Doctor Cavala while the CSOFAOC is 3:
	say "[one of]'Are you going to be okay?' you ask.

'I'll manage,' Doctor Cavala replies. 'As soon as you raise my leg so that my circulation doesn't kill me.'[or]Doctor Cavala just glares at you.[stopping]";
	now ambience suppression is true.
	
Does the player mean putting Doctor Cavala on the waiting chairs: it is likely.

Before putting something on the waiting chairs when the CSOFAOC is 3 (this is the convert putting to taking for first aid rule):
	if the noun is Doctor Cavala or the noun is Doctor Cavala's leg:
		try taking Doctor Cavala instead.

Before pushing, pulling, or taking Doctor Cavala's leg when the CSOFAOC is 3 (this is the convert injury actions to Doctor Cavala actions for first aid rule):
	try taking Doctor Cavala instead.
	
Before pushing, pulling, or taking Doctor Cavala when the first aid bag is carried and the CSOFAOC is 3 (this is the drop the first aid bag before raising Doctor Cavala's leg for first aid rule):
	say "(first putting down the first aid bag)[command clarification break]";
	try silently dropping the first aid bag;

Instead of pushing, pulling, or taking Doctor Cavala when the CSOFAOC is 3 (this is the raise Doctor Cavala's leg for first aid rule):
	now the first aid bag is undescribed;
	now the first aid bag is closed;
	say "Taken --

Doctor Cavala grits her teeth and screws her eyes shut. Her bloodstained trousers stick to your gloves. Her leg feels heavy and fragile in your hands, like a porcelain model that will shatter if you slip.

You think for a moment. 'He... could have visited the Crow's Nest as well?'

[wait for any key]She shakes her head. 'Think about it. Being seen in the Shanty Quarter, among thieves and lepers, would have destroyed his reputation as a businessman. More than that -- why haven't we heard of any other deaths in the Shanty Quarter? You've been there. You would have seen if anyone was exhibiting similar symptoms, and Crow or Webster would have mentioned it if there had been others. It couldn't possibly have started in the Shanty Quarter and only affected four people.'

Section 3.3.7.1.3 - A Scene of Eldritch Light and Mild Concern

Before going inside when the location is the Clinic and Heroes Never Die is happening (this is the going inside during Heroes Never Die means going to the surgery room rule):
	try going north instead.
	
Some light not of this world is a faraway scenery thing.
The description is "It has no shape, and yet you [italic type]see[roman type]."
The sound is "Silence."
The light not of this world has some text called the faraway response. The faraway response is "You don't know how you would begin."
Understand "imprint/imprints" or "long" or "shadow" or "grim" as the light not of this world.
Does the player mean doing something with the light not of this world:
	it is very likely.

When Heroes Never Die begins (this is the spawn the eldritch light in the Clinic rule):
	now the light not of this world is in the Clinic.
When Heroes Never Die ends (this is the despawn the eldritch light in the Clinic rule):
	now the light not of this world is nowhere.

Before approaching when Heroes Never Die is happening:
	if the noun is not the Surgery Room:
		say "You can't leave. Not with this [italic type]light[roman type].";
		stop.

Before going through the clinic front door when Heroes Never Die is happening:
	say "You can't leave. Not with this [italic type]light[roman type]." instead.

Before going through the mortuary stairs when Heroes Never Die is happening:

Chapter 3.3.8.1 - Scenery
	
Some late-afternoon sunlight is a faraway scenery thing.
The description is "The clinic shimmers in gold."
The late-afternoon sunlight has some text called the faraway response. The faraway response is "The sunlight is intangible."
Understand "sun" or "light" or "late" or "afternoon" as the late-afternoon sunlight.

The scent is "The flowers are dry and papery."
Instead of pushing, pulling, taking, or turning the touching memorabilia, say "There's no reason to redecorate now."

Understand "spirits" or "wandering" as the odd passing ghosts.

There is a plural-named scenery thing called your unfinished notes and diagrams.
The description is "[if Killed Justinian Ending is happening]The beginnings of a research paper on the Noctis vaccine. It's still a work in progress, but you have some promising results.[otherwise if Walked Away Ending is happening]The beginnings of a research paper on the Noctis-3 vaccine.

It's all for show, of course; your [italic type]real[roman type] research is kept in the laboratory downstairs."
Understand "research" or "paper" or "beginning/beginnings of/--" as your notes and diagrams.
Instead of looking under, searching, or taking your notes and diagrams, say "[if Usurper Ending is happening]Since no one is around, there's no need to pretend to be working.[otherwise]You aren't focused enough to work on your paper right now. Perhaps later."

Book 3.4 - Mortuary

The Mortuary is a proper-named room. "The odor of camphor is overwhelming in this gloomy subterranean chamber. Shelves along the walls house organs in jars of formaldehyde. Deeper in, cadavers are organized in labeled niches, embalmed and awaiting cremation.

A flight of stairs leads back up to the clinic."

The scent is "The smell of embalming fluid blankets everything here."
The exit reminder is "The only way out is back upstairs, to the clinic proper."

The simple-name is "the mortuary".
Before examining up in the Mortuary, try examining the stairs to the mortuary instead.
Before examining outside in the Mortuary, try examining the stairs to the mortuary instead.
Before going outside in the Mortuary, try going up instead.

Part 3.4.1 - Stairs to the Mortuary

Some stairs to the mortuary are an open unopenable scenery door. They are below the Clinic and above the Mortuary.
The description is "[if the player is in the Clinic]The stairs lead into darkness.[otherwise]Light streams down the stairs."
Understand "exit" as the stairs to the mortuary when the location is the Mortuary.

After going through the mortuary stairs while the player is staid: say "[if the previous location is the Clinic]You descend the steps into shadow...[paragraph break][otherwise]You emerge from the darkness of the mortuary...[paragraph break]"; continue the action.

Before putting something on the stairs to the mortuary, try dropping the noun instead.
Instead of smelling the stairs to the mortuary in the Clinic, say "The smell of embalming fluid is faint, but distinctive."

Part 3.4.2 - Scenery

The odor of tinctured camphor is scenery in the Mortuary.
Understand "embalming" or "fluid" as the odor of tinctured camphor.
Before examining or smelling the odor of tinctured camphor, try smelling the location instead.
Instead of doing anything other than examining or smelling to the odor of tinctured camphor, say "You can only smell it."

Some shelves of organs are a scenery supporter in the Mortuary.
The description is "The jars are meticulously labeled with names and dates."
Understand "organ" or "shelf" or "jar/jars" or "formaldehyde" or "eyeball/eyeballs" or "kidney/kidneys" or "liver/livers" or "name/names" or "date/dates" as the shelves of organs.
Instead of entering the shelves of organs, say "The shelves wouldn't support your weight."
Instead of searching the shelves of organs, say "There are twenty or thirty jars here. They contain eyeballs, kidneys, livers, and so on."
Instead of taking the shelves of organs, say "You can't imagine how that would be useful."
Instead of putting something on the shelves of organs, say "Doctor Cavala would be quite annoyed to find your things mixed in with the jars."
Instead of opening the shelves of organs, say "Formaldehyde is quite toxic. You shouldn't expose yourself to more than you have to."
Instead of removing something from the shelves of organs, say "You can't imagine how that would be useful."

The mortuary slab is a scenery supporter in the Mortuary.
Instead of examining the mortuary slab, say "It's a dais for cadavers to be laid on[if Reden's Autopsy is happening]. Reden's body and organs are presently occupying it[end if]."
Instead of entering the mortuary slab, say "[if Reden's Autopsy is happening]You shouldn't disturb Doctor Cavala while she's performing the autopsy.[otherwise]There's no need for that."
Instead of putting something on the mortuary slab when Reden's Autopsy is happening, say "Reden's body is already occupying the slab."

Some labeled niches are a scenery container in the Mortuary.
Understand "niche" as the labeled niches.
Instead of entering the labeled niches, say "You aren't dead yet, Marid."
Instead of examining the labeled niches, say "For each niche, a body."
Instead of inserting something into the labeled niches, say "The niches are reserved for cadavers."

Some embalmed cadavers are a dead mixed-race person in the labeled niches.
The description is "You feel a chill when you look at them."
Instead of searching the cadavers, say "All of the cadavers have been stripped of clothing and personal effects."
Instead of pulling or taking the cadavers, say "You can't imagine why you would want to do that."

Part 3.4.3 - Mortuary during Day One

[Day One begins when Reden is moved to the mortuary slab, so we don't have to specify that here.]

Instead of going from the Mortuary during Nine to Five Zombie, say "You should talk to Doctor Cavala to let her know you're here."

Chapter 3.4.3.1 - Reden and his Organs

Instead of cutting Reden during Reden's Autopsy, say "You should leave the autopsy to Doctor Cavala."
Instead of knocking on, pushing, pulling, rubbing, squeezing, taking, touching, or turning Reden during Reden's Autopsy, say "Not in the middle of an autopsy."

Reden's-organs are a plural-named privately-named scenery thing on the mortuary slab. The printed name is "Reden's organs".
The description is "Reden's organs are black and withered. You might have suspected poor embalming technique if it hadn't been Doctor Cavala performing the dissection."
Understand "Reden's" or "organ/organs" or "heart" or "lungs" or "trachea" or "respiratory" or "system" as Reden's-organs.
Instead of cutting Reden's-organs, say "You should leave the autopsy to Doctor Cavala."
Instead of eating Reden's-organs, say "Diseased organs are not food, Marid."
Instead of knocking on, pushing, pulling, rubbing, squeezing, taking, touching, turning, or waving Reden's-organs, say "You shouldn't handle the organs carelessly."

When Reden's Autopsy begins (this is the shift Reden's organs for Reden's Autopsy rule):
	now Reden's-organs are on the mortuary slab.
	
When Reden's Autopsy ends (this is the despawn Reden rule):
	now Reden is nowhere;
	now Reden's-organs are nowhere.

Chapter 3.4.3.2 - Cavala during Reden's Autopsy
	
Rule for writing a paragraph about Doctor Cavala during Reden's Autopsy:
	say "Doctor Cavala is here studying Reden's body with a loupe. His heart, lungs, and trachea are neatly laid out beside him on the slab.";
	now Reden is mentioned.
	
Instead of kissing, knocking on, pushing, pulling, rubbing, squeezing, taking, touching, or turning Doctor Cavala during Reden's Autopsy, say "She wouldn't like to be disturbed in the middle of an autopsy. Talking to her will be enough to get her attention."

The surgical loupe is a wearable thing.
The description is "A special adjustable lens, capable of a high degree of tunnel magnification."
Understand "special" or "adjustable" or "lens" as the surgical loupe.
Before searching the surgical loupe, say "It's difficult to look through the loupe without wearing it." instead.

When Reden's Autopsy begins (this is the initialize Doctor Cavala for Reden's Autopsy rule):
	now Doctor Cavala is in the Mortuary;
	now Doctor Cavala is wearing the surgical loupe;
	now the home dialogue branch of Doctor Cavala is cavala-errands.
	
When Reden's Autopsy ends (this is the despawn the surgical loupe when Reden's Autopsy ends rule):
	now the surgical loupe is nowhere.

To the southeast, the Via Terminalis bridges the canal. A condemned block is visible to the north, and a footpath follows the canal to the south. ";
	otherwise:
		say "You are adrift in the bustle of crowds and carriages, a raucous river that runs through the blood-vessel streets. Signage advertises a profusion of shops and services amid the sounds of leather rollers and stitching machines. In the distant mist, the Bilious Canal spills from the Channelworks into the heart of the city.

You can follow the Via to the west, or to the southeast where it bridges the canal. A condemned block is visible to the north. A hanging banner obscures an alley to the southwest, while a footpath follows the canal to the south. ";

'What about Riggertown? How do I get there?'

'Well, the footpath is closed at the moment, miss, so I'd advise waiting until tomorrow if you have business in Riggertown.' He scratches his chin. 'The only other way is through the Shanty Quarter, and that's no place for a lady like you to be. No offense, of course.'

'I see,' you say. 'You've been a big help.'[or]'Have you seen anything interesting lately?' you ask one of the guards.

'Not that I can tell,' she replies. 'But don't worry, miss. You'll be safe with us around.'[or]You shouldn't bother the guards too much. They have a job to do, after all.[stopping]".

Chapter 3.16.6.2 - The Tremendous Mess and Porter during Four Investigations

The tremendous mess is a faraway scenery thing.
The description is "Oceans of ink. Mountains of stationery."
The tremendous mess has some text called the faraway response. The faraway response is "The porter's hands are already full with the mess. You'd best leave it alone."
Understand "ocean/oceans" or "of" or "ink" or "mountain/mountains" or "stationery" as the tremendous mess.

Rule for writing a paragraph about the porter when Four Investigations is happening:
	if the tremendous mess is in the Turris Infinita:
		say "The porter is on her hands and knees cleaning up the tremendous mess you made earlier. She appears to be steadfastly ignoring you.";
	otherwise:
		say "The porter is silent at her desk."
		
Instead of examining the porter during Four Investigations, say "She looks peeved."
Instead of attacking or cutting the porter when the tremendous mess is in the Turris Infinita, say "There's no need. She's already received her comeuppance."
Instead of talking to the porter when Four Investigations is happening, say "[one of]'Excuse me --'

She doesn't acknowledge your presence[or]The porter is ignoring you[stopping]."

When Four Investigations ends (this is the despawn the tremendous mess rule):

Before approaching when the ornate double doors are locked:

Book 3.17 - Grand Forum

There is a proper-named listed-on-directory room in Outdoors called the Grand Forum. "[if Day One is happening]This immense paved square is alive with people of all kinds: couples, merchants, buskers. There are children flying their paper kites and old men watching the clouds drift by. A brilliant mural of Furopolis and Solphos hovers at the heart of it all[otherwise if Day Three has not ended]Aside from the mural of Solphos, this immense paved square is largely deserted. There are no couples, no merchants, no buskers -- nothing except for a chilly breeze that you can feel in your bones[otherwise]A mural of Solphos hangs over a desolate paved square, against the spires of the Channelworks District and the pungent smell of the dead. All around you are crowds of formless spirits and empty-eyed apparitions, which writhe and weep and claw at the mist like an unquiet sea[end if].

[if Day Three has not ended]The arch of Miller's Gate rules the east, and the curving canal cradles the basilica to the west. From the northern Via Terminalis junction, the Via Mercurii splits off and travels south[otherwise]To the north, framed in illuminated mist, the Via Terminalis glimmers[end if]."
It is south of the Junction.

The simple-name is "the grand forum".
The sound is "[if Day One is happening]The sounds of music and laughter fill the forum[otherwise]You hear only the whistling of the wind[end if]."
The scent is "[if Day One is happening]You smell ice cream and flowers mingling in the mist[otherwise if Day Three has not ended]You smell only the canal mist[otherwise]The mist is heavy with death[end if]."
The exit reminder is "You can go east to Miller's Gate[if Day One is happening], west to the basilica,[end if] north to the Via Terminalis junction, or south along the Via Mercurii."

Book 3.21 - Via Mercurii

There is a proper-named room in Outdoors called the Via Mercurii. "The Road of Change is a snaking, secretive thing. It curls in the side streets and in the dark places. Here along the canal, the opulence of the Upper Perioch peels away to reveal midnight hues and scarlet lamps, [if Day Four is happening]and rivers of black blood like festering scars in the city's skin[otherwise]cabarets and pawnbrokers and establishments of ill repute -- but for now, at least, they slumber in the daylight[end if].

To the north is the grand forum, [if Day One is happening]vibrant and lively[otherwise]bleak and empty[end if], while to the south the Shanty Quarter begins."

'Hello,' you offer.

'Good afternoon, young one.' His accent is disarming. 'Have you come in search of answers?'"	{teller-ihave, teller-ubeckoned, teller-curious}
teller-ihave	true	false	"'I have.'"	"'I have.'

'Then you've come to the right place.' The fortune-teller spreads his hands, and the deck of cards seems to leap and dance through his fingers. 'The Fates provide answers when life will not.

teller-ubeckoned	true	false	"'I came because you beckoned me.'"	"'I came because you beckoned me.'

'Yes, of course -- but there are a dozen buskers on these streets every day. Do you approach each of them when they beckon you?'

The fortune-teller continues to smile. He spreads his hands, and the deck of cards seems to cascade like water.

[wait for any key]'The cards tell me all I need to know. I can see the thoughts and dreams that trouble you. What should you do? Where will you go? The Fates can show us all these things and more.'"	{teller-dontknowme, teller-cards, teller-work, teller-patrons, teller-reading, teller-anothertime}

The fortune-teller bows his head. 'My apologies. We are strangers, of course. I don't presume to know the challenges you face --'

[wait for any key]He pauses mid-shuffle, the gilding on the cards glittering.

[wait for any key]'But the cards do.'

[wait for any key]Then he resumes, and pours the deck into another waterfall."	{teller-cards, teller-work, teller-patrons, teller-reading, teller-anothertime}
teller-curious	true	false	"'I was curious.'"	"'I was curious.'

'Ah, curiosity. I can hardly fault you. It's only natural to be curious about a tradition such as mine.'

The fortune-teller spreads his hands, and the deck of cards seems to fly apart and flow into itself.

'I am a reader of messages, of portents. We often ask -- What should I do? Where will I go? The cards can show us all these things and more.'"	{teller-cards, teller-work, teller-patrons, teller-reading, teller-anothertime}
teller-cards	true	true	"'I've never seen cards like these before.'"	"'I've never seen cards like this before.'

The fortune-teller nods enigmatically, and slowly riffles the deck for you to see. The card backs are baroque, inlaid with gold, brilliant with light as they collapse inward.

'The Aubedore,' he murmurs. 'The lost art. Here, you may not have heard of it. But the tradition exists, and I assure you that it is real.'"	{teller-lostart, teller-work, teller-disbelieve1, teller-patrons, teller-reading, teller-anothertime}
teller-lostart	false	true	"'What did you mean by [']the lost art?[']'"	"'What did you mean by [']the lost art?[']' you ask.

teller-work	true	true	"'How does it work?'"	"'How does it work?'

The fortune-teller holds the cards close to his chest. 'The strings of fate -- but perhaps you know them better as the chains of causality. They are intimately connected to all things in ways you can't imagine. By shuffling the cards, I am attuning them to your past, present, and future, to the parallels and possibilities.'"	{teller-cards, teller-lostart, teller-work, teller-disbelieve1, teller-patrons, teller-reading, teller-anothertime}
teller-disbelieve1	false	true	"'I don't believe in fate.'"	"'I don't believe in fate.'

teller-patrons	true	true	"'Do you get many patrons?'"	"'Do you get many patrons?' you ask.

'Many,' the fortune-teller replies. 'I've told the fortunes of the rich and poor, young and old. They all sought answers in their lifetime, and the cards helped them discover the way.'"	{teller-cards, teller-lostart, teller-work, teller-disbelieve1, teller-reading, teller-anothertime}
teller-reading	true	true	"'I'd like a reading.'"	"'I'd like a reading,' you say cautiously.

'Very well,' he replies. 'Please, sit down. What question do you wish to ask the Fates?'

You take your seat at the table, facing the fortune-teller. After a long moment, you give your answer."	{teller-love1, teller-work1, teller-past1}
teller-love1	true	false	"'There's a boy I like...'"	"'There's a -- a boy I like. I want to know if... if I'll be with him.'

You feel your cheeks heating up. You hate yourself for asking such a stupid, inane question. But you have to know.

'Ah, love.' The fortune-teller smiles. 'It tangles the strings of fate and leads us in mysterious ways. The pattern for it is sometimes known as the Dove's Tail, but I prefer to call it the Heart.'

He sweeps the deck across the table with a flourish, spreading out five cards in the shape of an arrowhead -- or, you suppose, a symbolic heart. At its very tip, he lays another card perpendicular over the first.

[wait for any key]'A pattern of meetings,' the fortune-teller murmurs. 'The Heart is the most selfless of the Aubedore patterns. It shows us how people are drawn together from the chambers...' He traces from the wings of the pattern to the tip. 'What awaits them at their shared destination.'

[wait for any key]You nod, transfixed.

[wait for any key]'Now we will reveal the cards, two by two, and see what they reveal about your future.'

[wait for any key]His gold-gloved hands hover over the chambers.

[wait for any key]'Shall we begin?'"	{teller-love2}
teller-love2	true	false	"<Watch him reveal the chambers.>"	"You nod. He touches the chambers of the heart, and brings them to light.

[wait for any key]On the left you see a pair of skeletons, one male and one female, and a young girl between them gripping their hands.

Your breath catches in your throat.

[wait for any key]'The Orphan,' says the fortune-teller quietly. 'I take it you have lost someone.'

[wait for any key]'I'm... I'm fine,' you say after a moment. 'I was taken aback. That's all.'

'Very well.'

[wait for any key]On the right is an upside-down card, illustrated with an indecipherable chimera of feathers and fur. But the fortune-teller seems to know it well.

[wait for any key]'The Griffin,' he says. 'Your love is of high birth.  And it is inverted, showing he is magnanimous rather than proud: a man of noble spirit.'

You smile inwardly.

[wait for any key]'The chambers mark your beginnings,' he continues. 'Now we move on to the paths which brought you together...'"	{teller-love3}
teller-love3	true	false	"<Watch him reveal the paths.>"	"The left path turns out to be a woman in archaic blue robes, bowed before a seemingly endless array of bookshelves. As you scrutinize the image, you realize she is only one of many supplicants, in one of many halls of an infinite library.

[wait for any key]On the right, upside-down, is a dark illustration of someone holding a lantern. You can barely make out the figure's outstretched hand, framed in flames and grasping for something out of sight.

[wait for any key]'The Student and the inverted Seeker,' says the fortune-teller. 'You went on a journey of learning, while your love became a man who commanded the attention of others. During your studies you met him -- perhaps a fellow student, or a young prodigy you looked up to. You learned from him and followed in his footsteps. Am I right?'

Your cheeks heat up again, and you can't find it in yourself to speak.

[wait for any key]'And now, the nexus,' he continues. 'Your meeting at the destination...'"	{teller-love4}
teller-love4	true	false	"<Watch him reveal the nexus.>"	"He slides out the bottom card first, and reveals it to be a depiction of a storm at sea, heaving with rain-lashed ships and alive with forked lightning. Above all in the sky is a terrible sphere that can only be the [italic type]Luna[roman type].

'The Tempest,' he whispers. 'You will be drawn together in a time of change and turmoil. Perhaps years from now. Perhaps tomorrow. Only time will tell -- and the final card, your fate, the answer to your question...'

[wait for any key]The last card is a woman all in white, kneeling beside a dying man.

[wait for any key]The fortune-teller picks up the sideways card, his hand trembling slightly. You realize he is holding it upside down.

'The Healer,' he says. 'Inverted.'

[wait for any key]You inhale sharply.

'Don't -- don't worry. It's not as literal as it might seem.' He takes a deep breath. 'The inverted Healer is a symbol of renouncement and parting. All it means is... that you and your love will one day be separated. Your relationship will not last forever. You should cherish it as long as you can.'

[wait for any key]His hand continues to tremble."	{teller-isee, teller-lovereallymeans}
teller-lovereallymeans	true	false	"'Tell me what it really means.'"	"You look him in the eye. 'Tell me what it really means.'

The fortune-teller regards you for a long moment.

[wait for any key]At last he says, 'One of you is fated to die.'

[wait for any key]He places the Healer face down."	{teller-isee, teller-disbelieve2}
teller-work1	true	false	"'A man died in the clinic where I work...'"	"'A man died in the clinic where I work. I want to know what happened to him.'

The fortune-teller's smile fades, and he nods more seriously.

'You pose me a sober question, my friend,' he says. 'I will endeavor to ask the cards on your behalf. Let's see what the River pattern has to tell us about your patient.'

He upturns his hand. Cards slide off the deck and onto the table in a flowing line. With his other hand, he turns the path of the cascade until a curving tangent has been formed.

[wait for any key]'The River flows from the source,' he says, 'through the upper course and the bend, into the lower course and the delta. Here, the tributary is fed by the lake.'

[wait for any key]He gestures to each of the face-down cards in sequence.

[wait for any key]'Now we will reveal the cards, one by one, and see what they reveal about the flow of causality.'

[wait for any key]His gold-gloved hand hovers over the source.

[wait for any key]'Shall we begin?'"	{teller-work2}
teller-work2	true	false	"<Watch him reveal the upper river.>"	"You nod. The fortune-teller touches the source, and brings it to light.

[wait for any key]The illustration is of an ancient forge, immaculately detailed and filled with artifacts of esoteric design. You see swords and cups, cloaks and crowns. But in front and center, set above the rest, is a band of purest, most exalted gold.

[wait for any key]'The Ring,' says the fortune-teller. 'The most brilliant of the Fixtures. The source was a device, or perhaps a discovery, that possessed vast potential.'

[wait for any key]The next card is upside down, and all you can make out is a crowded and colorful vignette. But in the center, almost unnoticeable, is one stooped figure devoid of color.

[wait for any key]'The Servant. The lowliest in the realm of the court, so humble as to go unnoticed. But it is inverted; I dare say your patient drew unexpected attention, for good or for ill.'

[wait for any key]The third card bears a young woman's face in stark definition, with blue eyes eerily like your own, but with only pale skin where her mouth should have been. You involuntarily touch your lips.

[wait for any key]The fortune-teller shakes his head. 'The bend is the Mute. The event, then, the death, had to do with silence. But did your patient die because he did not speak out... or was he killed to ensure he never did?'

[wait for any key]He purses his lips.

'Let us take a step back, and see if the tributary sheds light on the mystery.'"	{teller-work3}
teller-work3	true	false	"<Watch him reveal the tributary.>"	"He reveals the card, and it turns out to be an idyllic scene of the land before the Darkening, a picture of a forest with green trees and blue skies. In its center is a body of still and silvery water.

[wait for any key]'The Pond,' says the fortune-teller. 'It represents a place far from civilization where one can reflect and find reflection. It is the indirect cause -- could the discovery have been made in such a place? The place your patient drew attention? Or did he not speak out because civilization would not have heard him?'

[wait for any key]You frown. 'I came here for answers, not more questions.'

[wait for any key]'I am sorry you feel that way, my friend,' he replies. 'I can only convey what I can see with my own eyes, and what the cards see fit to provide. The Fates can be temperamental even at the best of times.

[wait for any key]'But look! There are still three cards we have not revealed.'"	{teller-work4}
teller-work4	true	false	"<Watch him reveal the rest of the river.>"	"'We have seen what has come to pass,' he says, reaching for the lake. 'Now we see what could have been...'

[wait for any key]The card bears the image of an old woman in a dungeon. She is strung up by iron manacles and horribly withered, with her emaciation illustrated in exacting detail.

[wait for any key]'The Manacles.' A grimace. 'If not for your patient's death, someone would have been imprisoned. Yes, an unpleasant picture is beginning to emerge...'

[wait for any key]The fortune-teller turns over the lower course, revealing it to be another dark and disturbing illustration; but upside-down, so that you can only see a bone-white figure.

[wait for any key]'Ah!' he declares. 'The Ghost appears, but inverted. The dire message it brings is not heard, and the course of fate is not changed. And that brings us to our final card, the delta --'

[wait for any key]The delta is a storm at sea, heaving with rain-lashed ships and alive with forked lightning. Above all in the pitch-black sky is a terrible sphere that can only be the [italic type]Luna[roman type].

[wait for any key]The fortune-teller sets the card down.

[wait for any key]'The Tempest,' he whispers. 'The future will be filled with change and turmoil. It could be in many years, or it could be tomorrow. And all because of a humble man who drew the wrong attention -- and was silenced.'

A long pause."	{teller-isee, teller-areyousure, teller-drivel}
teller-past1	true	false	"'I've been having nightmares...'"	"'I've been having nightmares. I've had them for years. I thought I got over them, but... I had another one, just last night.'

The fortune-teller grows sober. 'Dreams,' he says. 'Nightmares. They show us truths that cannot be found in the daylight. If you wish to learn how to conquer them, one pattern will prove most illuminating...'

He casts his hands apart, scattering the top cards of the deck with the sudden motion, and at first you wonder if he's dropped them by accident. But when the loose cards come to rest, they have landed in an deliberate, intricate pattern -- a cross.

[wait for any key]'The corners,' he says, tapping the cards at the end of each of the four arms. 'The spokes,' he continues, moving inward in counter-clockwise fashion. 'And the nexus --'

He taps the two cards in the center, one laid perpendicular over the other, and you nod transfixed.

[wait for any key]'The Crossroads.' he says. 'It shows us the paths that lead to our destination. Now we will reveal the cards, one by one, and see what they reveal about you.'

[wait for any key]His gold-gloved hand hovers over the top left corner. 'Shall we begin?'"	{teller-past2}
teller-past2	true	false	"<Watch him reveal the corners.>"	"With great showmanship, he turns over the first card.

[wait for any key]Some kind of hound or beast stares out at you, with smoke-gray fur and menacing slitted eyes. The visage is unfamiliar, terrifying.

'The Wolf,' says the fortune-teller. 'It represents danger, and the fear that comes with isolation.'

[wait for any key]The next card depicts a girl at an old-fashioned spindle, with strings wound through her hands and feet and hair. But to your surprise, the card is upside down.

[wait for any key]'The Seamstress, inverted.' the fortune-teller continues. 'In the past, you experienced a traumatic event -- one that severed the ties binding you to friends and family. You were set adrift.'

[wait for any key]The lower right card is a young girl flanked by skeletons, one male and one female, staring at you with hollow eye sockets, and you freeze.

[wait for any key]'The Orphan,' says the fortune-teller. 'I take it you have lost someone.'

[wait for any key]You can't find it in yourself to breathe.

[wait for any key]'How are you doing this?' you whisper.

[wait for any key]His voice is quiet. 'I know only what the cards have shown me. But I see now why you might be plagued by nightmares.'"	{teller-paststop, teller-past3}
teller-paststop	true	false	"<Get up and walk away.>"	"You take a deep breath.

You choke on it. Tears well up in your eyes.

You look at the skeletons and you --

[wait for any key][italic type]-- see the flames -- the smoke --

[wait for any key]-- hear his last words --

[wait for any key]-- all over again --[roman type]

[wait for any key]You squeeze your eyes shut.

[wait for any key]When you open your eyes, you're back at the table.

[wait for any key]You take a deep breath.

[wait for any key]Running won't solve anything. It won't make the nightmares go away.

[wait for any key]You have to see this through."	{teller-past3}
teller-past3	true	false	"<Stay seated.>"	"You grit your teeth. You grip your seat until your knuckles whiten.

[wait for any key]'Are you all right?' The fortune-teller sounds genuinely concerned.

[wait for any key]'I'm [italic type]fine.'[roman type]

[wait for any key]A long pause.

[wait for any key]'No,' he replies. 'You're not fine. You have been badly wounded.'

[wait for any key]The card in the lower left is a woman in white, kneeling beside a dying man, and it is upside down.

[wait for any key]You start to cry.

[wait for any key]It is the fortune-teller who first speaks again.

[wait for any key]'There is no shame in tears,' he says. 'No one is so strong that she cannot weep.'

[wait for any key]Some time passes. You aren't sure how much.

[wait for any key]But it is with a defiant breath that you wipe away the last of your tears."	{teller-past4}
teller-past4	true	false	"'I'm all right. Let's move on.'"	"'I'm all right,' you say. 'Let's move on.'

The fortune-teller looks at you, then nods. His hand moves inward, to the top left spoke.

[wait for any key]Inward from the Wolf is a slab of horned metal, massive and unyielding. It glows with the heat of the flames surrounding it.

'The Anvil,' says the fortune-teller. 'Your trials have strengthened you more than you think. Fire will never break or bend you.'

[wait for any key]The spoke from the Seamstress shows an ancient road, leading straight ahead into the dawn on the horizon.

'The Path. Without ties to bind you, you are free to move ahead. You should look to the future, not the past.'

[wait for any key]From the Orphan, you see a woman in slumber, encircled by a tapestry of images executed in dizzying detail.

'The Dreamer. Yes, you are a dreamer in more than one sense, whether or not you realize it...'

[wait for any key]The final spoke is upside down, and it is illustrated only with a morass of dark shapes -- but the fortune-teller nods with apparent understanding.

'And from the Healer,' he says, 'the Shadows. Also inverted. Something will soon emerge from the shadows and be made known to you... and I suspect it is linked to everything that has gone before. But only you will see it.'

[wait for any key]The fortune-teller inclines his head.

'There are only two cards left. Let us see what the Fates have in store for you.'"	{teller-past5}
teller-past5	true	false	"<Watch him reveal the destination.>"	"He holds the upper card in place, while drawing out the lower. 'The destination,' he says, 'reveals the truth -- the true path that you must take...'

[wait for any key]The card is inverted. It shows a gray stone tablet, planted alongside flowers; the inscription is slick with rain, and there is a melancholy quality to the illustration.

'The Gravestone,' he says curiously. 'It represents mortality, inevitability. But inverted...'

[wait for any key]He furrows his brow, and without another word, turns over the other card.

[wait for any key]A storm at sea, heaving with rain-lashed ships and alive with forked lightning. Above all in the pitch-black sky is a terrible sphere that can only be the [italic type]Luna[roman type].

[wait for any key]'The fate,' he breathes. 'The Tempest.'

[wait for any key]He clasps his hands and leans heavily on the table. For a long while, he is silent."	{teller-isee, teller-whatmean}

Section 3.32.2.1.2 - Zoiro Mourning Dialogue, Branching Investigative Section

[In this little specimen of spaghetti code, Marid asks Zoiro about various topics, which lead to new potential topics. What happens here is that all of the dialogue branches have every possible choice, but the 'enabled' property is only turned on for the branches once they have been unlocked.

We use the 'one-shot' property to see which branches have already been unlocked before so we don't unlock them again: false means they haven't been unlocked by the player, true means they have.

The starting branch is aboutreden, which branches to:
	-werentclose
	-placesfrequented
	-associations
	
From these we get the following:
	-unemployed
	-heleft
	-drinker
	
And finally the following critical clues:
	-channelworks
	-pub
	-redenshack
	
Once Marid has asked all of the final three, we unlock the final dialogue branch, which is alldone.]

Book 3.33 - Rats' Run

Rats' Run is a proper-named room. "The Bilious Canal's runoff rises. It swallows these buildings and alleys in dark writhing water. Unsteady plank bridges run between the few islands of dry stone; hollow-eyed residents crowd around what lanterns pierce the gloom.

A sewage pipe spews outflow from the north. Above, rope ladders climb to the rest of the Shanty Quarter."
It is below the Shanty Quarter.
Understand "rats" or "pits" as Rats' Run.

The sound is "The air is stale, deadened by water."
The scent is "The canal reeks."
The exit reminder is "You can go up the rope ladders to the rest of the Shanty Quarter."

Before examining inside in Rats' Run, try examining the sewage pipe instead.
Before examining down in Rats' Run, try examining the Bilious Canal's runoff instead.
Before examining north in Rats' Run, try examining the sewage pipe instead.
Instead of examining up in Rats' Run, say "Crumbling buildings crowd out the sky."

Before going inside in Rats' Run, try going north instead.
Before going down in Rats' Run, try swimming instead.

Part 3.33.1 - Scenery

The mist, the slum-dwellers, and the Bilious Canal's runoff are in Rats' Run.

Some unsteady plank bridges are scenery in Rats' Run.
The description is "They creak and bend with every step."
The sound is "[italic type]Creak[roman type]."
Understand "bridge" as the unsteady plank bridges.
Instead of entering the unsteady plank bridges, say "You're already trying not to think about the way the bridges creak underfoot."
Instead of looking under the unsteady plank bridges, say "Beneath the bridges, the Bilious Canal swims like a predator."
Instead of pushing, pulling, rubbing, taking, touching, or turning the unsteady plank bridges, say "One wrong move could dislodge the bridges. You shouldn't touch them any more than you absolutely have to."

Some few islands of dry stone are scenery in Rats' Run.
The description is "Ruins, husks, collapsed remnants of the buildings that came before. They are nothing but stepping-stones now."
Understand "island" or "stepping" or "stones/stepping-stone/stepping-stones/ground" or "ruin/ruins" or "husk/husks" or "collapsed" or "remnant/remnants" or "building/buildings" or "gloom" as the few islands of dry stone.
Instead of entering the islands of dry stone, say "That's where you're standing."
Instead of searching or looking under the islands of dry stone, say "The canal has already swallowed all their secrets."
Instead of touching the islands of dry stone, say "Well, not all that dry."

Some improvised lanterns are scenery in Rats' Run.
The description is "Hollowed-out tins of phlogiston; ruptured flickering animus lamps."
The scent is "Smoke and ozone."
Understand "lantern" or "tin/tins" or "of" or "phlogiston" or "animus" or "lamp/lamps" as the improvised lanterns.
Instead of burning the improvised lanterns, say "The lanterns are already lit."
Instead of extinguishing the improvised lanterns, say "You see no reason to do that."
Instead of looking under the improvised lanterns, say "Only shadows."
Instead of pushing, pulling, or turning the improvised lanterns, say "The lanterns are fixed in place."
Instead of searching the improvised lanterns, say "They're just lanterns."
Instead of taking the improvised lanterns, say "You don't need a lantern."
Instead of touching the improvised lanterns, say "You don't want to."

The sewage pipe is an open unopenable scenery door. It is north of Rats' Run and south of the Flooded Row.
The description is "Black water gushes from a grille of broken teeth."
The sound is "The pipe ululates."
The scent is "It smells awful."
Understand "outflow" or "grille" or "broken" or "teeth" as the sewage pipe.
Before climbing the sewage pipe, try entering the sewage pipe instead.
Instead of looking under the sewage pipe, say "Outflow pours from the sewage pipe into the water."

Some creeping rope ladders are scenery in Rats' Run.
The description is "They hang from above, knotted, rotted."
Understand "knot/knots/knotted" or "rot/rotted" or "ropes" or "ladder" as the creeping rope ladders.
Before climbing or entering the creeping rope ladders, try going up instead.
Instead of looking under the creeping rope ladders, say "The rope ladders dangle just above the ground."

Part 3.33.2 - Rats' Run during Day Two

Instead of entering the sewage pipe when Day Three has not ended, say "Climb into the sewage pipe? You'd rather not."

The dismembered pigeon is a neuter creature animal in Rats' Run. "Nearby, a dismembered pigeon floats in the water."

First before doing anything when the current action involves the dismembered pigeon:
	say "You take a step closer --[paragraph break]";
	wait for any key;
	say "The pigeon's remaining eye snaps open. It twitches madly.[paragraph break]";
	wait for any key;
	say "It opens its beak as though to cry out. Tendons snap and trail free. Canal-water floods into its mouth -- it sinks bloody beneath the surface of the water --[paragraph break]";
	wait for any key;
	say "And it is gone. As though it was never there.";
	now the dismembered pigeon is nowhere;
	stop the action.
	
When Four Investigations ends (this is the despawn the dismembered pigeon rule):
	now the dismembered pigeon is nowhere.
	
Part 3.33.3 - Rats' Run during Day Four

When Day Four begins (this is the Day Four tragic duo rule):
	now Webster is in Rats' Run;
	now Webster is described;
	now the home dialogue branch of Webster is webster-d4-home;
	now Crow is in Rats' Run;
	now Crow is undescribed;
	now Crow is dead;
	now the stick of chewing gum is nowhere;
	now the disheveled shirt is nowhere;
	now the feathered hairpin is nowhere;
	now Crow's mouth is part of Crow.
	
Crow's mouth is a faraway scenery thing.
The description is "It is a darkness you know well."
Understand "thin" or "stream" or "of" or "black" or "liquid" or "edge" as Crow's mouth.
Crow's mouth has some text called the faraway response. The faraway response is "There's no point."

Rule for writing a paragraph about Webster when Day Four is happening (this is the Day Four Webster description rule):
	say "The bouncer from the Crow's Nest sits quietly by the shore, cradling Crow's body in his arms."

Instead of examining Webster when Day Four is happening, say "[The Webster] stares into the water, transfixed."
Instead of talking to Crow when Day Four is happening, say "You reach out, but there is nothing to grasp. Her soul has been so irrevocably damaged that there is almost nothing left of her to speak to."

Book 3.34 - Flophouse

There is a room called the Flophouse. "This place was once a beautiful townhouse; now it is a ruin. The walls have been stripped of their furnishings, leaving bone-white plaster and rotting wood. Vagrants sleep on the stairs or in the corridors, curled up in makeshift bedding and soused with laudanum or alcohol.

To the west is the exit. To the south, [if cellar-access-granted is true]a trapdoor descends to the cellar[otherwise]a passageway leads to the rooms[end if]."

The sound is "It's uncannily quiet."
The scent is "The flophouse smells of ash."

Part 3.34.2 - Flophouse during Day Two

Chapter 3.34.2.1 - The Landlord

[This character is a reference to the writings of XS, one of the best and most twisted questmistresses I've ever encountered on /tg/.]

The landlord is a neuter mutant person in the Flophouse. "In the reception office, a nightmarish many-armed creature crouches, and pores obsessively over an assortment of keys."
The description is "There's something deeply unnatural about the way it moves. You have to look away before you get a headache."
The sound is "[The landlord] is murmuring to itself."
The scent is "There is a whiff of something oily and faintly pelagic."
Understand "many-armed/armed/arm/arms" or "many" or "nightmarish" or "creature" as the landlord.
Instead of attacking, cutting, or pushing the landlord, say "You don't think that would be a good idea."

landlord-title-known is a truth state that varies.
Rule for printing the name of the landlord when landlord-title-known is false: say "creature".

The assortment of keys is a thing carried by the landlord.
The description is "Crudely fashioned keys, jangling together on loops of wire."
Understand "key" or "assorted" or "crude/crudely" or "fashioned" or "loop/loops" or "wire" as the assortment of keys.
Instead of searching the assortment of keys, say "You can't see much while it's moving the keys around."
Instead of taking the assortment of keys, say "You don't think [the landlord] would appreciate that."

Does the player mean examining the assortment of keys: it is likely. [As opposed to Sal's battered keyring.]

Before giving the battered keyring to the landlord, try talking to the landlord instead.
Instead of giving Doctor Cavala's signum to the landlord, say "[The landlord] doesn't even look."

Chapter 3.34.2.2 - Gating the Cellar

cellar-keygiven is a truth state that varies.
cellar-access-granted is a truth state that varies.
cellar-noaccess-quipped is a truth state that varies.

First before going south in the Flophouse when cellar-access-granted is false (this is the spoopy Room IV gating message rule):
	if cellar-noaccess-quipped is false:
		say "You take a step into the passageway, only to hear a screeching from behind you. A rubbery tentacle snaps tight around your foot.[paragraph break]";
		wait for any key;
		say "[italic type]'You,'[roman type] [the landlord] hisses, its voice crawling on your neck. [italic type]'Not resident. Not key-bearer. No more steps. No more. Understand?'[roman type][paragraph break]";
		wait for any key;
		say "'I-- I understand,' you stutter. 'Please don't hurt me.'[paragraph break]";
		wait for any key;
		if cellar-keygiven is true:
			say "[italic type]'Learn which room. Tell which room. Then... change, reconsider.'[roman type][paragraph break]";
		otherwise:
			say "[italic type]'Show me key. Show me key-teeth. Then... change, reconsider.'[roman type][paragraph break]";
		wait for any key;
		say "The creature withdraws. You rub your neck with a trembling hand.";
		now cellar-noaccess-quipped is true;
		now clue-salkeyneeded is true;
	otherwise:
		if cellar-keygiven is true:
			say "The landlord said that you had to tell it which room Sal's key unlocked before it would allow you to go in.";
		otherwise:
			say "[The landlord] said that you had to show it a key before it would allow you to go in.";
	stop the action.

Part 3.34.3 - Flophouse during Day Four

When Day Four begins:
	now the Flophouse is goto-impassable.

Instead of going to the Flophouse during Day Four, say "The doorway to the flophouse is choked with corpses."


Book 3.35 - Cellar

There is a room called the Cellar. "A dimly lit mouse-hole of a hollow that has been bricked off from prying eyes. A pair of mattresses lie near the entrance, where Sal and Piper must have slept. Further in, a guttering candle on the only table illuminates bladed weapons, counterfeit bills, and other contraband.

A trapdoor ascends out of the cellar."

The simple-name is "the cellar".
The sound is "You hear the faint sounds of vermin squeaking."
The scent is "There is a strange odor in the air."
The exit reminder is "You can only go upstairs, back to the flophouse."

Before going outside in the Cellar, try going north instead.
Before going up in the Cellar, try going north instead.
Before examining outside in the Cellar, try examining north instead.
Before examining up in the Cellar, try examining north instead.
Instead of examining north in the Cellar, say "The exit is that way."

The trapdoor to the cellar is south of the Flophouse and north of the Cellar. [I have to put this here because Inform 7 is trash when it comes to objects with names that include other names.]

Part 3.35.1 - Scenery

The dimly lit hollow is scenery in the Cellar.
The description is "This is a place for vermin, not for people."
Before listening to or smelling the dimly lit hollow, now the noun is the location.
Understand "mouse-hole/mousehole/hole" or "of" or "brick/bricks/bricked" or "dim" or "mouse" as the dimly lit hollow.
Before inserting something into the dimly lit hollow, try dropping the noun instead.
Before putting something on the dimly lit hollow, try dropping the noun instead.
Instead of entering the dimly lit hollow, say "You're standing in it."
Before getting off the dimly lit hollow, try going outside instead.

Some dingy mattresses are scenery in the Cellar.
The description is "One is big; the other, small."
The scent is "The mattresses certainly smell criminal."
Understand "pair" or "of" or "mattress" or "bed/beds" as the dingy mattresses.
Before entering the dingy mattresses, try sleeping instead.
Instead of sleeping when the dingy mattresses are in the location, say "You'd really rather not."
Instead of looking under the dingy mattresses, say "Nothing under there but cockroaches."

Some cockroaches are faraway scenery in the Cellar.
The description is "Cockroaches haven't scared you since you were a little girl. They are, however, deathly irritating things."
The cockroaches have some text called the faraway response. The faraway response is "The cockroaches scurry away before you can get close."
Understand "cockroach/roach/roaches/vermin" as the cockroaches.
Instead of attacking the cockroaches, say "[one of]Whap! You missed.[or]Pow! You missed.[or]Slap! You missed.[or]Ha! Got one![or]All right, that's enough. You can't spend the whole day killing cockroaches.[or]You can't spend the whole day killing cockroaches.[stopping]".

Part 3.35.2 - The Incriminating Table

The incriminating table is a scenery supporter in the Cellar.
The printed name is "table".
Instead of examining or searching the incriminating table, say "There are many shapes that glisten in the candlelight, but that wine bottle seems the strangest."
Instead of putting something that is not the gift note on the incriminating table, say "You shouldn't leave your things lying around here."

The guttering phlogiston candle is scenery on the incriminating table.
The description is "A slow-burning phlogiston candle. It looks as though it was lit some days ago, then forgotten."
Understand "slow-burning/burning" or "slow" as the guttering phlogiston candle.
Instead of burning the guttering phlogiston candle, say "The candle is already lit."
Instead of extinguishing the guttering phlogiston candle, say "You don't like it, but you need the light to see by."
Instead of listening to, pushing, pulling, rubbing, smelling, squeezing, taking, touching, or turning the guttering phlogiston candle, say "You don't want to."

"[if the service lift platform is intact]Engraved before you are the glyphs that conduct the galvanism of the service lift, and barely -- just barely -- keep it from plummeting away into the abyss[otherwise]You've scratched out the glyphs that were once inscribed here.

Book 3.43 - Passage of Tears

The Passage of Tears is a room. "In this lightless passage, the air is still and the sounds of the world seem to die. Yet the tunnel is alive nonetheless: it teems with raindrops, seeping from unseen cracks, sparkling with mirth as they reflect the dancing eye of your animus-light.

[wait for any key]'Now it is my turn to answer,' he says. 'You asked me, my child: what is this place? It is a church, if you would like to call it that.

Justinian's face is twisted with the specter of anguish. He looks around, but he does not see you. He paces through the freezing aisles, clutching his coat close to his shivering shoulders as he scans the corners and the shadows.

[wait for any key]'Marid, Marid, Marid,' he says, in a voice that is almost cracked from grief. 'Please... Marid... tell me you're here.'[wait for any key before prompt]"	{justinian-d3fin-callout, justinian-d3fin-remainhidden2}

You watch as Justinian painstakingly searches the room, sometimes sobbing, sometimes begging for a sign. His hands are shaking as he struggles with the glyphs on the isolation chambers. He opens one only to find it empty, and slams the door shut with a scream of frustration.

[wait for any key]'Please, Marid, please,' he repeats hoarsely. 'Please be okay. I can't lose you. I can't lose you...'

justinian-d3fin-remainhidden3	true	false	"<Remain hidden.>"	"He goes around the room, opening and closing each isolation chamber in turn, calling your name over and over with such despair that you can't take it any longer. You just can't.

There are some things that you have to do."	{justinian-d3fin-callout}
justinian-d3fin-callout	true	false	"'Justinian?'"	"'Justinian?'

Your voice is a thin thread, a whisper that must be almost inaudible from outside the walls of your prison. But if it is a whisper, it is one with the power of a lightning bolt.

[wait for any key]Justinian stands bolt upright, and his eyes widen and he looks around madly.

[wait for any key]'Marid!' he says. 'Marid? Marid, is that you?'

[wait for any key]'Justinian. I'm here.'

[wait for any key]You tap the safety release glyph and the door opens. With a hiss the cool air rushes in, and the light, and a feeling of relief like a held breath finally letting go.

[wait for any key]Justinian takes a couple of steps forward and embraces you. His dirty cheeks are stained with tears.

[wait for any key]You feel weightless with Justinian's arms wrapped around you. He is close, and he is warm, and his heart is filled with fire. A part of you notifies your conscious mind that your cheeks are burning. But the embarrassment is less, somehow, after you have already died once.

[wait for any key]'Marid,' he murmurs, almost under his breath. 'I've been looking everywhere for you. Do you know how insane this is? You could have died.'

[wait for any key]'I know,' you say. 'I know. Listen --'

[wait for any key]'Marid, it's not safe here. You need to --'

[wait for any key]'Justinian, listen to me,' you say. 'I've found the source of the contagion. It's being produced right here in this laboratory. There's a stack of research notes on that desk. You need to tell the inquest to get a team down here so that... so that...'

[wait for any key]Something is wrong.

[wait for any key]Justinian's demeanor has not changed. He has shown no surprise, no reaction apart from his concern.

[wait for any key]There is no more warmth in his embrace -- only a kind of sickening smoldering hurt that makes you want to throw up.

[wait for any key]'I wish I didn't have to do this,' he says. 'I promise, Marid. I promise that one day you will forgive me.'

Book 3.51 - Oubliette

The Oubliette is a room. "[oubliette-description]"

To say oubliette-description:
	if the animus lantern is no-longer-lit:
		say "You are somewhere dingy and humid and shut off from the outside world. There is no light here, and even your second sight is not enough to pierce the suffocating gloom. ";
		if d4-lantern-condition-seen is true:
			say paragraph break;
			say "If not for the tenebrous other-light of your pendant, you would scarcely be able to see your own body. ";
	otherwise:
		say "The light of your lantern reveals what looks to be an industrial cistern, now emptied and repurposed as a holding cell. A metal chair has been placed among dingy grates and concentric water-purification rings. There is only one door leading out of this prison, and it appears to be locked.[paragraph break]";
		if the broken porridge bowl is in the Oubliette:
			say "But beside the broken porridge bowl and discarded pieces of rope, there is ";
		otherwise:
			say "But beside the disconcerting stains and discarded pieces of rope, there is ";
		if the promising-looking drain cover is closed:
			say "a drain cover that looks like it can be opened. ";
		otherwise:
			say "an open drain cover just wide enough for you to squeeze through. "

The simple-name is "the oubliette".
The sound is "The thrum of the Channelworks is in the walls."
The scent is "The air is stale with decay."
The exit reminder is "[if the animus lantern is no-longer-lit]You can't see any way out of this place.[otherwise]The only exit available to you is down through the drain cover."

Before going when the location is the Oubliette and the animus lantern is no-longer-lit: say "You fumble aimlessly in the darkness, to no avail." instead.

Before examining inside when the promising-looking drain cover is in the location, try examining the promising-looking drain cover instead.
Before examining outside when the promising-looking drain cover is in the location, try examining the promising-looking drain cover instead.
Before examining down when the promising-looking drain cover is in the location, try examining the promising-looking drain cover instead.

Before going inside when the promising-looking drain cover is in the location, try entering the promising-looking drain cover instead.
Before going outside when the promising-looking drain cover is in the location, try entering the promising-looking drain cover instead.
Before going down when the promising-looking drain cover is in the location, try entering the promising-looking drain cover instead.

Part 3.51.1 - Scenery

The suffocating gloom is faraway scenery in the Oubliette.
The description is "The darkness is impenetrable."
The suffocating gloom has some text called the faraway response. The faraway response is "That doesn't make any sense."
Understand "darkness" or "room" or "oubliette" or "wall/walls" as the suffocating gloom.
Before smelling or listening to the suffocating gloom, now the noun is the location.
Instead of entering, knocking on, pushing, pulling, rubbing, searching or touching the suffocating gloom, say "You can hear heavy machinery moving around you. There must be a less dangerous way to find your way around."

The metal interrogation chair is scenery in the Oubliette.
The description is "You're glad to be free of it."
Instead of climbing the interrogation chair, say "That won't accomplish anything."
Instead of entering the interrogation chair, say "You'd rather not."
Instead of taking the interrogation chair, say "You don't see any reason to carry the chair around."
Instead of pushing the interrogation chair to, say "You don't see any reason to push the chair around."

Some discarded rope bits are scenery in the Oubliette.
The description is "What remains of your rope bindings is scattered on the floor."
Instead of taking the discarded rope bits, say "The leftover bits of rope are too short to be of any use."
Understand "binding/bindings/bit" or "ropes" or "piece/pieces" as the discarded rope bits.

Chapter 3.51.1.1 - Post-Darkness Scenery

A post-Oubliette-darkness-thing is a kind of thing. [This is a kind, not a property, to reduce property bloat and thus memory bloat]

The broken porridge bowl is a scenery post-Oubliette-darkness-thing.
The description is "Justinian's bowl is upturned on the floor, along with ceramic shards and puddles of cold porridge."
Understand "shard/shards" or "fragment/fragments" or "ceramic" or "puddle/puddles" or "cold" as the broken porridge bowl.
Instead of eating or drinking the broken porridge bowl, say "Absolutely not."
Instead of knocking on, pushing, pulling, taking, touching, or turning the broken porridge bowl, say "You don't think the broken porridge bowl will be of any use in escaping this place."

Some dingy grates are a scenery post-Oubliette-darkness-thing.
The description is "Small square dividers bleached white by alchemical processing. They must lead to other cisterns like this one."
Understand "grate" or "divider/dividers" as the dingy grates.
Instead of closing the dingy grates, say "The grates are already closed."
Instead of opening or entering the dingy grates, say "The grates seem to be impossible to remove without specialized equipment. They were not made for people to crawl through."
Instead of attacking or cutting the dingy grates, say "By the time you carve out an appreciable opening with your scalpel, Justinian's plan will already have succeeded."

Some concentric water-purification rings are a faraway scenery post-Oubliette-darkness-thing.
The description is "Forbidding feats of sigilwork. You assume they're for purifying water."
The scent is "The air smells sharp around them."
Understand "water" or "purification" or "ring" or "sigil/sigils" as the concentric water-purification rings.
The concentric water-purification rings have some text called the faraway response. The faraway response is "You shouldn't tamper with industrial sigils you aren't familiar with."

Some disconcerting stains are a scenery post-Oubliette-darkness-thing.
The description is "Perhaps it would be best not to think about what else this room has been used for."
The scent is "You don't make out any unusual smells from the stains. Perhaps that's because of the purification sigils in the cistern."
Instead of rubbing or touching the disconcerting stains, say "The stains don't come off."
Understand "stain" as the disconcerting stains.

The cistern door is a closed locked scenery door. It is east of the Oubliette and west of the Placeholder Cistern Door Room.
The description is "It doesn't seem to be openable from the inside."
The sound is "You hear the muffled sounds of the Channelworks through the door."
Instead of opening the cistern door, say "The door doesn't seem to be openable from the inside. There has to be another way out."
Before doing anything with the cistern door when the animus lantern is no-longer-lit: say "It's too dark to see what you're doing." instead.

The promising-looking drain cover is a scenery post-Oubliette-darkness-thing.
The promising-looking drain cover can be open or closed. The promising-looking drain cover is closed.
The promising-looking drain cover can be openable or unopenable. The promising-looking drain cover is openable.
The description is "On the other side of the drain, there is the sound of rushing water."
The sound is "It sounds as though the drain cover leads somewhere into the Channelworks drainage system."
The scent is "It smells like chlorine."
Understand "hole" or "opening" as the promising-looking drain cover.
After opening the promising-looking drain cover, say "You open the drain cover, revealing an opening that is just about wide enough for you to squeeze through."

To place post-Oubliette-darkness-things in the newly lit Oubliette:
	now every post-Oubliette-darkness-thing is in the Oubliette;
	if the enabled of justinian-d4int-dontdrink2 is true, now the broken porridge bowl is nowhere.

	wait for any key;

[wait for any key]You avert your eyes and shake your head as he tries to feed you the porridge. As far as you can tell, there's nothing unusual about it. But knowing that [italic type]he's[roman type] the one holding the bowl is enough to take all your appetite away.

[wait for any key]'Marid,' he says quietly. 'Marid, Marid, Marid.'

[wait for any key]'What's wrong?' he asks.

[wait for any key]Everything is wrong. But in a way that you cannot describe. Your heart sinks as it hits you -- the full ramifications of what has happened, and what is now happening. You feel as though your head is spinning and the world is slipping away.

'Reden? You must mean the drunkard.'

Justinian places his hands on his hips and starts to pace.

[wait for any key]'He was...' he begins. 'He was an unfortunate casualty. He kept coming to the outflow of the Channelworks. He tripped our alarm sigils. At first I believed he had discovered something.

[wait for any key]'In the end, we decided to let him drink in peace. But we were careless. One of our Noctis tanks... sprung a leak.'

[wait for any key]You recall the thin black strand that led you from Reden's haunt to the storage room.

[wait for any key]Justinian lowers his eyes. 'It was a hairline fracture. I didn't notice until it was too late. By then, he had already been exposed.'

[wait for any key]'Then Reden's death... was an accident?'

[wait for any key]Justinian folds his arms. 'I would have taken more precautions in hindsight. I don't... Perhaps he didn't deserve to die. But I knew the risks when I set out to do this. If a few accidents are the cost of changing the world... so be it.'"	{justinian-d4int-whykillthugs, justinian-d4int-whykillarturus, justinian-d4int-whyepidemic, justinian-d4int-whycarnicer, justinian-d4int-explainserpens, justinian-d4int-whytellme}

'Why?' Justinian looks almost surprised. 'Marid, you've been all over the Channelworks District. You know the Greater Corindia Trading Company, don't you? They are criminals, Marid. They are parasites. They are the worst aspects of society congealed into a tumor.'

[wait for any key]'They don't kill people with biological weapons.'

[wait for any key]'Marid, Doctor Arturus was in debt to them.' Justinian's eyes flash. 'You weren't there, Marid. You don't know what they did. What they were capable of. Scum like that doesn't deserve to... to even breathe the same air as us.

[wait for any key]'When I needed test subjects for Noctis, I didn't have to think twice. Nacarat and his goons were the first ones to die because I knew the Channelworks District would be a better place without them.'"	{justinian-d4int-whykillreden, justinian-d4int-whykillarturus, justinian-d4int-whyepidemic, justinian-d4int-whycarnicer, justinian-d4int-explainserpens, justinian-d4int-whytellme}
justinian-d4int-whykillarturus	true	true	"'Why did you kill Doctor Arturus?'"	 "'Why... why did you kill Doctor Arturus?'

Justinian's face darkens, and he turns away.

'Arturus...'

[wait for any key]He gazes contemplatively at his hands.

[wait for any key]'I held him in high regard. I believed in his ideals. He was the best pathologist in Furopolis, I'm certain. Perhaps the best in the world.'

[wait for any key]His jaw tightens.

[wait for any key]'I wish...' he says. 'I wish he had understood. What he had on his hands... a weapon that could topple nations. A power that could change things for the better. But he didn't see it that way. All he saw, when he looked at Noctis, was a tool of destruction.'

[wait for any key]'Maybe he was right,' you say.

[wait for any key]'He was wrong.' Justinian clenches his fists. 'He was wrong, and he was deluded. Trapped in the past. Death is not an end, Marid. It is a means, a tilling of the soil for a new beginning. We could have done so much...'

[wait for any key]He exhales.

[wait for any key]'I tried to reason with him,' he finishes. 'But he was too set in his ways.'

[wait for any key]'And you killed him for that?'

[wait for any key]'There was no other way.' His voice is quiet. 'There was... there was nothing else I could have done. He would have ended the plan before it started. Destroyed his own creation, after I had spent so long following in his footsteps.

[wait for any key]'I couldn't let that happen. I had to make him look like another victim.'

[wait for any key]You gaze at Justinian. 'If I don't agree with you, will you kill me too?'

[wait for any key]He looks away and does not reply."	{justinian-d4int-whykillreden, justinian-d4int-whykillthugs, justinian-d4int-whyepidemic, justinian-d4int-whycarnicer, justinian-d4int-explainserpens, justinian-d4int-whytellme}
justinian-d4int-whyepidemic	true	true	"'Why did you start the epidemic?'"	 "'Why did you start the epidemic?'

Justinian puts his hands in his pockets and looks into the distance.

'I thought you might ask that question,' he says. 'Let me ask you a question in return.

[wait for any key]'Marid, have you ever wondered why the people of the Shanty Quarter suffer? They are good people. Hardworking people. Their hands are just as able as yours or mine. So why do they still starve? Why do they languish without homes? Without jobs? Without even the pity of the Council of Works to protect them?

[wait for any key]'The truth is that there is no place for them here. The Channelworks District has no room for them. Furopolis has no room for them. There is an upper limit to the number of people that can be made to live in one space.'

[wait for any key]You glare at Justinian. 'And the epidemic is your way of... of [italic type]culling[roman type] them?'

[wait for any key]Justinian's face hardens, and his voice becomes humorless.

[wait for any key]'Don't get me wrong, Marid. I don't enjoy killing. I never have. But do you remember what I said? Death will happen with or without us. The people in the Shanty Quarter will die with or without me.

[wait for any key]The only question is -- should they be made to bear a lifetime of suffering first? Scrounging for scraps and inflicting the same burden on generations of children? Should their descendants be forced to suffer because we couldn't imagine an alternative?

[wait for any key]'With Noctis, we have a choice. They have a way out. And it pains me to say this, but killing them may be the [italic type]only moral choice.[roman type] Even an atrocity such as this may be justified if it averts countless lifetimes of suffering.

[wait for any key]'That is why I am doing this, Marid. I am killing them, yes -- but I am [italic type]euthanizing[roman type] them. I am setting them free.'"	{justinian-d4int-whykillreden, justinian-d4int-whykillthugs, justinian-d4int-whykillarturus, justinian-d4int-whycarnicer, justinian-d4int-explainserpens, justinian-d4int-whytellme}
justinian-d4int-whycarnicer	true	true	"'Why did [the Carnicer] try to kill me and Doctor Cavala?'"	 "'Why did [the Carnicer] try to kill me and Doctor Cavala?'

'Carnicer.' Justinian clenches his fists. 'I didn't... She was out of line. I told her specifically that you were not to be harmed. But she took matters into her own hands.'

[wait for any key]'Why?' you whisper. 'Why send her?'

[wait for any key]Justinian shakes his head. 'I never had a choice. If I could have resolved this any other way...

[wait for any key]'After Doctor Arturus, I realized you and Doctor Cavala were the only remaining obstacles to my plan. Doctor Cavala is too paranoid... too set in her ways, like Arturus was. Given time she would realize what was happening and formulate a cure. And all of this --' He sweeps his hand across the room. 'All my plans would have been for nothing.'

[wait for any key]'So you... you sent an [italic type]assassin[roman type] after her?'

[wait for any key]'There was no other option.' His voice is strained. 'Negotiating with her was too risky. A bomb or poison would have put you in danger. I believed -- I thought that hiring a hitman was the best solution.

[wait for any key]'I didn't account for Carnicer's unprofessionalism. Her cruelty. Had I known that she would go after you... I would have killed her myself.'"	{justinian-d4int-whykillreden, justinian-d4int-whykillthugs, justinian-d4int-whykillarturus, justinian-d4int-whyepidemic, justinian-d4int-explainserpens, justinian-d4int-whytellme}

'Doctor Serpens is my accomplice,' Justinian says. 'He has helped to misdirect the authorities, to manage the logistics of transmission. He is the kind of person you need on your side when performing an operation on this scale.

[wait for any key]'How should I say this...' He exhales. 'I wish I didn't have to work with him. Doctor Serpens is an evil man -- he sees this as a cruel game, an opportunity to perfect his masterpiece in spite of the cancellation of his project.

You feel an awful pressure. Your eyes are misty with tears. There is no longer any point in pushing it away -- so you let it happen.

[wait for any key]You let the pain in. You let yourself cry -- first softly, into the darkness, then with your whole heart.

[wait for any key]Justinian has ripped something out of you, you think. There was a part of you that still clung to hope -- to girlish dreams and childhood crushes and happy thoughts. That part of you is less, now. There will always be gnawing away at it a seed of doubt.

[wait for any key]Perhaps it is better this way. Perhaps it was always too much to hope for.

[wait for any key]The minutes blur together; for how long you do not know. Time is a strange thing when you only have the emptiness for company. But after the pain there is numbness, and after the numbness there is quiet, and after the quiet there is something resembling normalcy.

	now the purse is carried by the player;
	now the scalpel is carried by the player;
	now the practitioner's badge is carried by the player;
	now the animus lantern is in the Oubliette.

Part 3.51.6 - Relighting the Animus Lantern

d4-lantern-condition-seen is a truth state that varies. d4-lantern-condition-seen is false.

Rule for writing a paragraph about the animus lantern when the animus lantern is unlit and the animus lantern is in the Oubliette and d4-lantern-condition-seen is false:
	say "At the foot of the chair, a faint glimmer of other-light outlines the shape of your [animus lantern]. But the lantern is dark, and its [phylactery cathode] no longer shines."

Understand "glimmer" or "other" or "other-light" as the animus lantern when the animus lantern is in the Oubliette and d4-lantern-condition-seen is false.
	
Before examining, searching, taking, or switching on the animus lantern:
	if Day Four is happening and the animus lantern is unlit and d4-lantern-condition-seen is false:
		show the Day Four animus lantern condition scene;
		stop the action.

To show the Day Four animus lantern condition scene:
	now d4-lantern-condition-seen is true;
	now the animus lantern is carried by the player;

d4-animus-pendant-condition-seen is a truth state that varies. d4-animus-pendant-condition-seen is false.

Understand "other" or "light" or "other-light" as the animus pendant when the location is the Oubliette and the animus lantern is no-longer-lit and d4-lantern-condition-seen is true.

To decide whether the animus pendant can be considered for relighting:

Book 3.52 - Flooded Row

The Flooded Row is a room in Outdoors. "Between towering foundations, the rain lashes rusting hulks and flapping canvas shelters; it eats away at corpses piled in ankle-deep water. Where once there were buildings, posters, lamplights, the Bilious Canal has burst through the polder and swept them all away, carrying off the detritus of innumerable unknown lives.

Through an open sewage pipe, you see lights to the south."

The simple-name is "the flooded row".
The sound is "The wind sings a dirge."
The scent is "The rain stings your nostrils."
The exit reminder is "The only exit is the sewage pipe to the south."

Before examining inside in the Flooded Row, try examining the sewage pipe instead.
Before examining outside in the Flooded Row, try examining the sewage pipe instead.
Before examining south in the Flooded Row, try examining the sewage pipe instead.
Before examining down in the Flooded Row, try examining the up-close Canal instead.

Before going inside in the Flooded Row, try going south instead.
Before going outside in the Flooded Row, try going south instead.
Before going down in the Flooded Row, try swimming instead.

Part 3.52.1 - Scenery

The mist and the up-close Canal are in the Flooded Row.
Understand "ankle-deep" as the up-close Canal when the location is the Flooded Row.

Some towering foundations are scenery in the Flooded Row.
The description is "Black stone edifices."
Understand "black" or "stone" or "edifice/edifices" or "wall/walls" or "foundation" as the towering foundations.
Instead of climbing the towering foundations, say "These featureless stone walls are impossible to climb."

Some rusting hulks are scenery in the Flooded Row.
The description is "Antique carriages and other machines, dumped here to rust."

[wait for any key]'I wish it was so easy,' you say. 'If only it were so easy -- that we could stand in this tower, and snap our fingers, and it would fix everything. But life isn't like that.

[wait for any key]He looks out the window. His eyes are hard, his jaw set. Doctor Serpens's blood oozes down the front of his coat, slowly, in long dark fingers.

[wait for any key]'It will all be worth it,' he says.

[wait for any key]'Will it, Justinian? Will it?' You circle around and grab his shoulders, making him face you. 'How many lives have you destroyed? How many people have you put in the ground?

[wait for any key]Lightning flashes once more, illuminating the two of you. The rim of Justinian's face glows in stark relief, light against shadow.
